## Repository Structure

Our content is structured as follows:

- `courses/`
  - `course_name/`
    - `section_name/`
       - `lesson_name/`
          - `lesson_content.md`

Each course is contained within its directory, and for each course, you will find directories for each lesson, which contain a Markdown file (.md) with the lesson's content.
