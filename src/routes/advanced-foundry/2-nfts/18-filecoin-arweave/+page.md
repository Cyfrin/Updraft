In today's rapidly developing digital world, decentralized storage solutions are increasingly becoming the go-to for storing NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) metadata. Among these solutions, Rweave and Filecoin stand out as the most popular. They present exciting opportunities for users to deploy their NFT metadata in a flexible and secure manner.

We'll explore these innovative storage platforms, diving deep into their core principles and benefits. Moreover, we'll also gain insights from a special guest, Ali, a developer relations engineer at the Filecoin Foundation.

## Decentralized Storage Solutions - Rweave and Filecoin

To help you understand the concept of storing NFT metadata using decentralized storage solutions, we need to focus on two key players in the field - Rweave and Filecoin.

1. **Arweave**

Arweave is a decentralized storage network that makes data immune to modification, ensuring data validity over very long periods. This is an ideal solution for anyone looking for a permanent database.

2. **Filecoin**

Providing reliable and cost-effective storage, Filecoin is a decentralized protocol that propels the open-market for data storage services.

A great tool to help deploy your NFT metadata onto decentralized storage solutions such as Filecoin is **NFT Storage**. This site makes the deployment process seamless and smooth. You're not limited to SVGs on-chain; you can also upload actual images onto these decentralized storage solutions.

## An Expert's Take: The Vision of Filecoin

Bringing expert insight into this subject, we welcome Ali from the Filecoin Foundation. Ali shares her view on the mission of Protocol Labs and Filecoin, as well as the vision they have to democratize the internet and web.

She elaborates on the growing importance of data in our daily lives and the tech stack, reinforcing its critical role in the web 3.0 revolution.

## Filecoin: The Data Storage Revolution

Filecoin, since its launch in 2020, has been working tirelessly towards decentralizing the data infrastructure for the internet. Their layer one solution, Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), has launched some impressive functionalities.

- **Filecoin Data Deal Making:** It involves setting up an agreement between a client and a miner to store data.
- **Tokenization of Data Sets:** With tokenization, data can be protected securely and transparently.
- **Data DAOs:** Filecoin's on-chain tools allow data to be collectively owned and governed by an organization (DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

And many more use cases are being developed, showcased in the [Filecoin docs](https://docs.filecoin.io/).

To build a robust computation over all the useful data stored in Filecoin, they are focusing on layer Two (L2) and computation over data projects like IPC (Interplanetary Consensus Project) and Bacquio.

To get started with Filecoin, try deploying a smart contract to FVM, or use the storage helper - Web3 Storage or NFT Storage, to engage with the technology directly.

## The Role of ABI Encode Pack

But, what does all this mean, if we haven’t covered what Abi encode pack is and how it works? The Abi encode pack is an essential Ethereum function that we've been using throughout this course. It is used to define how data is formatted for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

In our following lessons, we'll explain Abi encode pack in detail using live examples. To get a head start, you can find all the course codes and images in the SRC sublesson.

In conclusion, the embrace of decentralized storage solutions like Rweave and Filecoin opens up a myriad of opportunities and functionalities for users to deploy and manage NFT metadata. It’s indeed an intriguing space with much to offer, and it’s only bound to grow more prevalent in the future.

Stay tuned for more information on the complexities of working with and understanding these storage solutions. Happy learning!
