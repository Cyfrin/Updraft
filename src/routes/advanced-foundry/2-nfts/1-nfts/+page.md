Hello there, coding enthusiasts! As we move forward in our Solidity journey, we're inching closer towards becoming proficient, practical Solidity developers, ready to take on real-world challenges. In today's session, we're diving straight into the fascinating world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs); afterward, we'll venture into the intricate web of DeFi, upgradable contracts, governance, and a glimpse into security. Excited? Let's get our hands dirty!

## A Quick Overview of the Code Base

Let's begin by exploring our course content. Our NFT project will entail creating dynamic NFTs of adorable dogs using VS Code. What's more, these tokens will evolve and carry fluctuating values. We aim to help you gain an in-depth understanding of NFTs, what makes them so special, and their functionality.

Eventually, we'll be able to add our NFTs right into our MetaMask, a thrilling outcome!

## An Introduction to Two Types of NFTs

Time to move onto specifics. There are two types of NFTs we will create:

1. **Basic NFT:** The basic (yet super exciting!) NFT will depict a cute little pug, which will be stored in InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
2. **Advanced NFT:** We'll move to the advanced level by designing an NFT stored entirely on-chain, a genuinely decentralized form. An interesting attribute of this NFT is that its SVG will fluctuate depending upon the mood state we assign.

Our goal is to give this NFT a dynamic personality, so to say, allowing it to mirror our mood swings. Just imagine—crafting mood-reflective tokens and importing them into an empty MetaMask!

### Looking Further: Selling the NFTs

Apart from MetaMask, we also aim to connect with platforms like OpenSea. This move will allow us an interactive space to sell our NFTs, engage with NFT communities, and do much more.

We'll cap things off by unraveling the mysteries of API and function selector codes, giving you a well-rounded understanding of these fundamental aspects of Solidity.

## Unraveling the NFT

After understanding our course layout, let's explore what an NFT is. NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, represent a unique set of data stored on Ethereum's digital ledger or blockchain. These tokens can literally represent anything — virtual real-estate, digital art, and much more! To give it a fitting analogy for our course:

Now, we're surely thrilled to begin. So, strap yourself in, and let's delve into the adventurous world of NFT creation in Solidity.

Stay curious, and stay tuned for our next session as we build, learn, and master the art of coding!
