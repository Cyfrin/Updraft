# New Fascinating Additions to the Mint DSC - Creating a Healthier User Experience

Let's dive right into the heart of the matter. We last left off exploring the updates on Mint DSC. Previously, we discussed the intricacies of the code and delved into how the DSC mint function operates within this codebase. In this post, we are going to understand this process in depth, throw light on the health factor, and discuss the possibility of self-liquidation by users. We will also guide you on how to prevent users from minting DSC that might break the health factor.

## Adding More Mint DSC

Notably, if any addition to this DSC causes a break in the health factor, we should retreat immediately. Why should we back off? Because it's not a very user-friendly experience. It could lead to users causing themselves to get liquidated. Technically, we could go forward and let users carry out the act. However, it would not reflect well on overall user experience. Consequently, it's crucial that we prevent any user from minting DSC that could potentiate the health factor break.

## DSC Mint Function - The Owner's Prerogative

The intricacies of the DSC Minting function deserves close scrutiny. Interesting to note, that the DSC has a `mint function` that can be invoked solely by its owner. The owner of this function, in this case, is the DSC engine.

Observe the following code block from `DecentralizedStableCoin.sol`:

```javascript
  function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (_to == address(0)) {
            revert DecentralizedStableCoin__NotZeroAddress();
        }
        if (_amount <= 0) {
            revert DecentralizedStableCoin__AmountMustBeMoreThanZero();
        }
        _mint(_to, _amount);
        return true;
    }
```

Through the above code, we notice that it returns a boolean. This boolean value enables us to understand if the minting was successful or not.

This function accepts two arguments - `address _to` and `uint256 _amount`. The `address _to` parameter is going to be assigned to the message sender and the `_amount` parameter will represent the amount of DSC being minted.

## Error Checks in the Minting Process

So what happens when the minting process fails? This possibility is taken care of in the following code snippet:

```javascript
  function mintDsc(uint256 amountDscToMint) public moreThanZero(amountDscToMint) nonReentrant {
        s_DSCMinted[msg.sender] += amountDscToMint;
        revertIfHealthFactorIsBroken(msg.sender);
        bool minted = i_dsc.mint(msg.sender, amountDscToMint);

        if (minted != true) {
            revert DSCEngine__MintFailed();
        }
    }
```

If the minting is not successful, signified by boolean value "false", the function reverts to an error. A new error title `DSCEngine__MintFailed()` is specified. Remember to create this error at the top of your script.

If the minting process fails, the function reverts to the error of `DSCEngine__MintFailed()`.

In conclusion, we have taken significant strides in enhancing the DSC and its related functions. These updates not only promote a healthier user experience but also prevent undesired system behaviors such as self-liquidation.

Dive into the code, brush up your knowledge, and let's continue exploring the ever-evolving world of coding together!
