# Celebrating a Milestone In Web 3.0 Project Development

In the world of programming and development, nothing quite matches the thrill, satisfaction, and accomplishment felt when navigating through a complex project and finally bringing it all together. This sense of achievement isn't just well-deserved, it is 1000% a badge of honor you should proudly display on your GitHub repo. If you've successfully navigated this far through the hardest, most complicated, and most advanced project in our Web 3.0 course, I tip my hat to you.

This section will recap the intricacies and nuances of our recent project, celebrate the milestones achieved, and look forward to what's next.

## Diving Into the Deep End of Web 3.0

This project drew on varied and cutting-edge concepts, many of which are at the forefront of Web 3.0's evolutionary curve. We delved into Decentralised Finance (DeFi), got hands-on with state-of-the-art fuzzing techniques and even dipped our toes into the landscape of digital security. We wrote an enormously advanced test suite, worked with Oracles, and built deploy scripts from scratch.

In all these, the emphasis was on leveraging safer methods and learning through interaction with diverse libraries. The course project also explored `failOnRevert`s and runs and depth of invariance tests.

Yet, the journey has not been devoid of learning omissions. We've not covered the crafting of a proper README. This is a 100% essential part of any comprehensive project and I strongly recommend you write one. To understand what it entails, you can refer to the [foundry-defi-stablecoin-f23 README](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-defi-stablecoin-f23/blob/main/README.md) for more clarity on its structure and content.

As I've said before, this project is lined up for an audit. The journey, as well as the audit reports, will be diligently documented in a new branch on this repository. Follow it and you can take cues from it for your own project's security journey. To successfully launch production code, you need to intimately understand security paths and the mechanics at play.

## Time to Recharge

The labour of software development can be taxing, which is why after your glorious achievement, you deserve a break. After your well-earned rest, I urge you to push this codebase up to GitHub and start tidying it - removing any redundant code and adding comments where necessary.

There's also an identified glaring issue with this project, which you might consider as your next challenge - perfect for after a break. Our code becomes insolvent if the price of the assets collapse too quickly. Perhaps you can come up with an ingenious way to fix it, and then maybe even launch your own stablecoin. Why not, right?

## Three More Steps To Glory

Energized after your break? Great! We only have three more lessons left to conclude this course. Here's a peek at what's coming next:

- Lesson 13: Foundry Upgrades
- Lesson 14: Foundry Governance | Plutocracy (And why it's bad)
- Lesson 15: Introduction to Smart Contract Security (All security interested parties...get here)

These topics are significantly more manageable than what you've already faced in the previous lessons. So ease back into your seat, and get ready for the next exciting stage of your Web 3.0 journey.

Pat yourself on the back, and relish in the success of coming this far, itâ€™s a milestone worth celebrating. Just three more steps, and you will have triumphantly conquered this comprehensive course. Here's to those final steps, and to seeing you at the finish line very soon!
