## Special Bonus: Gas Optimizations By Harrison Legg

But, before you hit the pause button, we've got a special piece of bonus content for you.

We are ecstatic to have Harrison Leggio, CTO and co-founder of Pop Punk, LLC, share some exceptional tips on gas optimizations. At Pop Punk LLC, they are building—`gaslight GG`, an audit firm specializing in gas optimization to ensure lowest possible gas costs. They are now venturing into building hyper optimized public goods tools for EVM developers, aiming at making the best and cheapest contracts accessible to all!

Harrison was graciously shared an enlightening step-by-step explainer on gas optimizations with a special focus on AirDrop contracts, highlighting common ways that may unknowingly inflate your gas costs in your smart contracts. The goal of his speil is to illustrate how you can beautifully weave in simple elements in your code to save substantial amounts of gas without rendering the code unreadable.

Find Harrison's detailed code explainer below.

(Add the provided gas optimization code)

_"The end result? The AirDrop 'Bad' costs 1,094,690 gas, while the 'Good' version only consumes 404,842 gas, creating a saving of nearly 600,000 gas by making only minor changes. This not only benefits you as a developer but also the end users who won't need to spend exorbitant amounts."_ – Harrison Leggio, CTO and co-founder of Pop Punk, LLC
