## Discussions

- Inside the GitHub repository, there is a [Discussions](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23/discussions) tab where you can ask questions and interact with fellow students and members.

## Course Tips

- Use the discussions tab!
  - Learning anything is more about knowing *where* to find the answer, as opposed to memorizing *what* the answer is. 
- Take breaks. Information absorption is critical. Don't rush through the course.
- Everyone learns at their own pace, set a pace and try to stick to it!
    - Example: 1 hour 4 days a week.
- The course is modular. Feel free to jump to sections that most interest you.
- Be collaborative. Engage with the community via GitHub discussions, forums, and other platforms.

## Working with AI

We will teach you best practices for working with Artificial Intelligence tools to become more efficient. However, always fact-check information with reliable human sources as AI can sometimes be incorrect. It is recommended you get an AI buddy to work with you during this course.

Some AI buddies might be:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
- [Phind](https://www.phind.com/)
- [Bard](https://bard.google.com/)

## Understanding Blockchain and Smart Contracts

Before diving into coding, it is vital to understand how blockchain works and the purpose of smart contracts. This is because technology is a solution, and understanding the problem is key to creating an effective solution. In this course, we will guide you through the fundamentals of blockchain technology and smart contracts.
