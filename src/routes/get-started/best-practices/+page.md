## Discussions

- Inside the GitHub repository, there is a <a href="https://github.com/Cyfrin/web3education.dev/discussions" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> Discussions </a> tab where you can ask questions and interact with fellow students and members.

## Course Tips

- Use the discussions tab!
  - Learning anything is more about knowing *where* to find the answer, as opposed to memorizing *what* the answer is. 
- Take breaks. Information absorption is critical. Don't rush through the course.
- Everyone learns at their own pace, set a pace and try to stick to it!
    - Example: 1 hour 4 days a week.
- The course is modular. Feel free to jump to sections that most interest you.
- Be collaborative. Engage with the community via GitHub discussions, forums, and other platforms.
