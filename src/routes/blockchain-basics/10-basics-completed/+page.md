## Venturing into The Coding Aspect

Now that you've grasped a lot of the basics and fundamental concepts of blockchain, it's time to delve into the coding aspect. This is where the more practical aspects of blockchain technology come into focus. The transition from theoretical insights to practical applications can be a thrilling journey, especially when we're talking about something as ground-breaking as blockchain.


### Learning Solidity Basics

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for implementing smart contracts on Ethereum-based blockchain platforms. To put it simply, if blockchain was a car, Solidity would be the engine that drives it, or more specifically, the language in which the engine's instructions are written.

Our next section will introduce you to the solidity fundamentals. This will equip you with the necessary skills to start coding in Solidity and offer an in-depth understanding of how smart contracts work under the hood.

At this juncture, it is appropriate to revisit your achievements. After all, learning is a continual process and every milestone deserves a celebration.
