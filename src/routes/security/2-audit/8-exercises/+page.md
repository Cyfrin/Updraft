## Continual Learning in Security Research

The landscape of security research changes rapidly. As key players in this space, we need to keep learning and adapting. It's only through constant exposure and education that we can stay ahead of attackers.

Any time a hack takes place, we have a chance to glean insights from the exploit and to improve our defenses against similar future threats. One efficient way of staying well-informed is by subscribing to security newsletters and reports.

> "Education and learning in the realm of security research are an ongoing journey, not a destination."

### Solidity and Other Learning Tools

To get started, there are various resources you can tap into. Here, I'll suggest some that I find particularly helpful:

1. **Solidit:** We plan to utilise Solidit later on in the journey, and registering now would give you a head start.
2. **Rekt News:** Personal favourite that gives updates consistently.
3. **Ethereum weekened &amp; Consensus Diligence Officer CIA:** Excellent sources to sign-up as well.

Sign up for a resource that suits your needs and preference. What matters is maintaining a continuous stream of information.

## Kick-starting Smart Contract Audit

Now that we've touched base with staying updated, it's time we turned our attention to the central theme of the day — a smart contract audit. This segment will provide a high-level overview of what it is and what the process looks like.

### The Password Store Audit

Particularly, we'll be focusing on the Password Store Audit. At the time of recording, this was a **CodeHawks First Flight Audit**.

Having covered all that, take a moment, take a deep breath, go through your notes or even better, stand up for a little stretch or go get a coffee. Once you’re ready, we will dive into an end-to-end audit with a minimal code base. Our mission? Stopping hackers from destroying our smart contracts and learning plenty about the audit process.

Before we jump into our first audit, make sure to take a break and prepare to give this your all.
