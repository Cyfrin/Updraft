# Wrapping Up Code Audits and Crafting Stellar Reports

Having navigated the vast sea of codebase, it's time to wrap it all up. We have two important tasks left on our plate – exploring the Slither/Adarin report and conducting some quality tests on the code. So let's dive right in, tie up these loose ends, and prepare a comprehensive report of our journey. Along the way, we'll demystify competitive audits, discuss their functioning, and learn how you can effectively participate in one.

Participating in a competitive audit requires the ability to comprehensively scrutinize code and identify loopholes. As we delve into this process, you'll get to grasp how you can submit a finding to a competitive audit platform. The real litmus test would be writing an audit report - and what better one to practice on than the Puppy Raffle?

In practice, writing a full report together may turn out to be a time-intensive endeavor. Hence, we won't always do this together. But fret not, it's an excellent practice to test your understanding of the audit process. And who better to guide you than me, Patrick?

If you'd prefer to write the report yourself and then compare it to mine, there's nothing stopping you. Remember, this is your opportunity to test yourself, gain insights, and hence prepare yourself for future competitive audits.

You can find our full report in Markdown within the 'audit data branch' of the repo, along with a PDF version. You will also find the output of our Adarin and Slither reports there, in case you want to compare yours and ensure its correctness.

> As a coder, if you aspire to delve into the nitty-gritty of competitive audits or just want to enhance your expertise on smart contract reviews, this is the place to be!

## Crafting Your Codehox Security Portfolio

With the completion of these tasks and the report, you'll have another smart contract security review or audit under your belt. Add it to your GitHub repo, and boom - you've taken one solid step in building your Codehox Security Portfolio.

That said, we're not quite done yet. Let's finish running Slither and Adarin, the two essential parts of our journey so far. Once we are done with these, we can then finally step into the realm of reporting, the summation of everything we've learned through this process.

Get ready for the exciting final step - drafting an insightful report that reflects all the hard work we put in during the learning process. Let's do this together! Happy Coding!
