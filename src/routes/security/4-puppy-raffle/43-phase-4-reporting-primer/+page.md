# How to Execute a Time Bound Security Review and Write an Effective Report

In security research, we know that the nitty gritty of reading and tinkering with code is just part of the big picture. At some point, you have to compile your findings and deliver a report that fully explains your work and its implications. To paraphrase a well-known off-color joke about necessary functions, everybody's got to do it, like it or not! So let's talk about how to do it well, and yes, even relish the process.

## Achieving Closure

Once you are reasonably satisfied with the code inspection phase, it's time to evaluate the data and summarize your findings into a clear, concise, and convincing report.

> It's the end of our code review and our job now, is to report our findings effectively. This is pivotal to our work as a security researcher and we should strive to do it right.

## Venturing into Competitive Audits

One of the first steps post-review would be to perform a competitive audit. Here, we will compare our findings to those of other security researchers, providing us perspective and reassurance about our work.

> Doing a competitive audit can supercharge our careers. It reinforces our learning and encourages us to be better. We will prepare a submission detailing our findings.

## Writing a Comprehensive Report

We will then delve into the crux of our task - the full report for the Puppy Raffle code we've been working on.

> It's not enough merely to discover bugs—successful discovery and exploitation often depend on being able to write a convincing report that shows why a bug must be fixed. Failure to do so could cost you a potential bounties or even your standing in the industry.

## The Art of Writing a Proof of Concept

In this journey, we will also be writing a lot of Proof of Concepts (PoCs). This is vital to your ongoing development as a security researcher, so practicing along is highly recommended.

## Pause to Reflect and Recover

If this has been a whirlwind so far, don't worry—you're not alone. I've packed your brain with loads of information, and it's now time to take it slow. As a thumb rule, it's best not to over-exert yourself. Doing so might lead to cognitive overloads and information fatigue.

> Take a pause; let the information sink in by giving your brain a well-deserved break. Go for a walk, do some push-ups, call a loved one, or perhaps pick up a book. Keep things varied to optimize your learning process.

Take at least a 20-minute break before returning to your task. You're doing a brilliant job and you're almost at the finish line – a comprehensive report of your security review.

## Girding up for Section Five

Remember, this is not the end of the road. Following the report compilation and submission, you're slated to dive into DeFi. This next section is what promises to boost your audit portfolio and take your skills to the next level.

In a nutshell, navigate this process at your own pace. The goal is to ensure an effective, in-depth review, and create a report worth its weight in gold. Absorb the learning, take timely breaks, and come back rejuvenated to deliver a stellar report.

> And always keep in mind: you're not just bug hunters, you're also bug salesmen. Being able to sell why a bug is important to fix is a crucial skill for success in this field.

See you on the flip side!

-Cheers!
