# Puppy Raffle Audit

Welcome to the in-depth discussion on the Puppy Raffle Audit! Conducting audits, particularly for smart contract security, is a necessity in the field of computer programming. Engaging in audits not only fine-tunes your coding skills, but it also gives your portfolio a significant boost.

What makes the Puppy Raffle Audit discussion interesting is that it is a current live event on the CodeHawks platform. This provides us with an opportunity to examine both private and competitive audits, helping you to hone your skills in writing professional audit findings.

## CodeHawks First Flights

CodeHawks First Flights offers an excellent platform for budding smart contract security researchers. This platform contains relatively easy-to-understand codebases that resemble those you will find in this guide.

If you are a beginner, this reference will help you familiarize yourself with the nuances of code auditing. More experienced auditors will find it a chance to reiterate their learning and uncover new strategies.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this section, you will:

- Familiarize yourself with your first set of tooling.
- Understand what static analysis is and its role in enhancing protocol security.
- Gain an insight into the different exploits in this codebase.
- Finally, learn how to write reports of competitive audits and differentiate them from private audits.

## Your Journey

Throughout your Puppy Raffle Audit journey, you will encounter a range of exploits in a sophisticated codebase. To cover more ground, this guide also includes case studies because historical attacks offer valuable lessons in improving security measures.

Here’s your itinerary:

1. Familiarize yourself with the Puppy Raffle audit codebase.
2. Pinpoint and analyze numerous exploits inherent in the codebase.
3. Conclude the mission with the production of a professional audit report.
4. Learn how to create competitive audit reports that catch the eye for selections.

## Diving Into the Audit

Ready to take the plunge into the audit? Scroll to section four and select the repo to get started. You'll come across two branches: the **main** branch and the **audit data** branch. Unlike prior projects, the onboarding document of this project is already successful.

Under these branches, you will find detailed information including compatibilities, roles, known issues, the audit scope, and more. At this point, you have everything you need to embark on your audit journey. Just beware, future audits will demand more extensive onboarding so this super-detailed manual while making things easier, may set unrealistic expectations!

Although it could be helpful to dive straight into the answers given here, it isn't advisable. The real learning and skill-building come from individually tackling the codebase, unraveling the codes, and discovering the attack vectors.

In the case of the Puppy Raffle, there are four high severity vulnerabilities awaiting discovery. Bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this exercise is to thwart those looking to exploit these vulnerabilities. Every bug or issue you identify and report prevents potential hackers from exploiting the protocol.

```
"There are always attackers looking to break these protocols, and we need to keep that in mind when we're working on them."
```

So gear up, as the world of the Puppy Raffle audit has many secrets waiting to be unveiled!
