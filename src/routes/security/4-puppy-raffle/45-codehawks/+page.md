# Starting Your Flight in Bug Hunting: An Easy Guide

Hello, everyone! Today, let's dive into the process of participating in your first code auditing competition, or as we like to call it - First Flight. Also, it's the perfect time for you to put your bug-finding skills to the test, thanks to an ongoing 'First Flight' code review competition. So, without further adeui, let's kick things off.

## Your Ticket into the Flight

First Flight is about to take off and it's time for you to be a part of it. Right now, the event 'Puppy Raffle' is offering you a fantastic opportunity to dive in and try your luck at finding the odd bugs in the code. Not only does this give you a chance to compete, but you also stand the chance to submit your first finding!

## Making the Leap

Be it the desire to learn, or the adrenaline pushing you to compete in a live, critical audit where real stakes are involved - the choice is yours. Remember, live contests are more challenging because they aren’t expected to have any bugs in the codebase. But if you're looking for a stepping-stone to level up your skills, these First Fights are just the thing for you.
