# Reviewing Code with Solidity 0.7: The Pros and Cons

As a developer, you’re probably curious about why you should use a newer version of Solidity, like 0.8.18. Let’s explore the impact and the benefits.

## Understanding the Impact

First, it’s important to address the question, “What’s the impact?” The answer is not as straightforward as one might expect. The impact is not substantial in the sense that using an outdated version of Solidity like 0.7 won't drastically damage or otherwise hinder your code.

However, upgrading to a later version could potentially improve your codebase significantly, making it more efficient and less prone to bugs. So, no significant negative impact, but likely a considerable positive one if you opt to upgrade.

> "Optimizing a codebase isn't about making massive changes all at once, but implementing small, incremental improvements that together make a difference."

## The Findings

Let's delve deeper into our findings. In our analysis of various codebases, we have identified several areas where Solidity 0.8.18 has advantages over 0.7.

1. Better error handling: Coding is often an exercise in problem-solving, particularly when those problems involve unanticipated errors. Solidity 0.8.18 offers improved error handling, saving you time on debugging and issue resolution.
2. Enhanced security: Security is paramount in any coding project, big or small. The later version of Solidity comes with added security features that minimize potential threats.
3. Greater efficiency: As with any updated version of a programming language, Solidity 0.8.18 is designed to perform tasks more efficiently than its predecessor. This could translate into faster execution times and a smoother user experience.

## Sugguested Actions

Given these findings, our recommendation is simple: Using an outdated version of Solidity is **not** recommended. Please use a newer version like 0.8.18.

In transitioning to Solidity 0.8.18 from 0.7, here are some next steps:

- Make a backup of your existing codebase.
- Install Solidity 0.8.18 on your computer (Here's a handy [installation link](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.18/installing-solidity.html)).
- Begin updating your scripts one by one. Start with non-critical scripts to test the waters before you get to more crucial parts of your code.

## Further Improvements

For further suggestions, we can borrow from the [Slither Documentation](https://github.com/crytic/slither). Slither, a Solidity static analysis framework, offers many resolutions to common coding issues. You can directly apply their tactics to your code to make it better.

To add to the report based on our findings, we've reformatted and used some points directly from Slither.

After applying these actions, you should be able to note the enhancements in your Solidity code. From our experience, it's always better to keep up to date with newer versions of such languages, and Solidity is no exception.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while using an outdated version like Solidity 0.7 may not have a massive negative impact, upgrading to the newer version, like Solidity 0.8.18, can make your coding life a whole lot easier and more efficient. Happy coding!
