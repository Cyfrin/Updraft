## Account Abstraction Lesson 4: `PackeduserOperation`

In this short lesson we are going to cover the `PackedUserOperation`, which was introduced and imported in the previous lessons. It is basically a collection of different types of information that together define an operation that a user wants to perform. Let's take a closer look.

> ‚ùó **NOTE** The lines of code dealing with gas fees, limits, and verification - as well as `bytes initCode` - are to be ignored for now.

```js
struct PackedUserOperation {
    address sender;
    uint256 nonce;
    bytes initCode;
    bytes callData;
    bytes32 accountGasLimits;
    uint256 preVerificationGas;
    bytes32 gasFees;
    bytes paymasterAndData;
    bytes signature;
}
```

`address sender`: This is the address of our minimal account, the one performing the operation.

`uint256 nonce`: This is a number that helps keep track of the sequence of transactions. It's a way to ensure each transaction is unique and not repeated.

`bytes callData`: This is where we put the important stuff. For example, if our minimal account wants to approve spending 50 USDC tokens, this is where that information goes.

`bytes paymasterAndData`: This can be used to customize who pays for the transaction. It might include details of another account that will cover the transaction costs.

`bytes signature`: This is the digital signature of the sender, used to authenticate the transaction and prove that it was indeed created by the sender.

So, in essence, this structure is a detailed blueprint of a transaction, containing everything needed to process and verify it on the blockchain.

Take a moment to reflect on these concepts. When you are ready, move on to the next lesson.
