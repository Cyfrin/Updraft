# Account Abstraction Lesson 2: Code Overview

Welcome to lesson 2 of the Account Abstraction course! In this lesson, we will take a look at the codebase for Ethereum and zkSync. They are minimal accounts and serve as a great starting point for learning about account abstraction.

## What You Will Learn

This is just an overview of things to come. You don't need to understand fully at this point. However, going through the links below can help to give you a glimpse of what is to come in the course. 

We will be building two minimal account abstraction accounts. One for Ethereum and another for zkSync.

You can check them out here: [Minimal Accounts](https://github.com/Cyfrin/minimal-account-abstraction/tree/main/src)

Or, you can head straight to the main sources below.

- [README file](https://github.com/Cyfrin/minimal-account-abstraction/blob/main/README.md)
- [Ethereum - `MinimalAccount.sol`](https://github.com/Cyfrin/minimal-account-abstraction/blob/main/src/ethereum/MinimalAccount.sol)
- [zkSync â€“ `ZkMinimalAccount.sol`](https://github.com/Cyfrin/minimal-account-abstraction/blob/main/src/zksync/ZkMinimalAccount.sol)

These two ecosystems are vastly different. The upcoming lessons will allow us to become more familiar with both of them. For now, we can see some examples from the README file. Click on ZkMinimalAccount.sol to see the example deployments for zkSync and MinimalAccount.sol for Ethereum.

When you are ready, let's begin our journey with Ethereum minimal account abstraction.
