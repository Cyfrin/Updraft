### Congratulations

Welcome back, you've made it to the end of this course! We've covered an enormous amount of content and you should be incredibly proud.

To those looking to become smart contract security professions, I have some resources that I recommend you check out next.

- [**Solidity Security: Comprehensive list of known attack vectors and common anti-patterns**](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html)
  - This site details a huge number of security vulnerabilities in this space that you should absolutely know about
- [**Damn Vulnerable Defi**](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/)
  - Tincho himself offers this gamified avenue to practice smart contract security and to experience attack vectors first hand
- [**Ethernaut**](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)
  - OpenZeppelin offers another great gamified platform to learn smart contract vulnerabilities
- [**Solodit**](https://solodit.xyz/)
  - An amazing platform that aggregates audit reports from the top auditors and firms in the industry. This is **_the_** place to see how it's done in the real world.
- [**Cyfrin**](https://www.cyfrin.io/)
  - Anyone building their own protocol who needs an audit can of course always check out our auditing platform, Cyfrin.
- [**Updraft Security & Auditing Course**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/security)
  - Since the creation of the Foundry course Updraft has launched a dedicated Security & Auditing curriculum, anyone serious about security in the space needs to check it out.

Whew, a sincere congratulations for making it through this course. Myself and the entire Web3 community are glad to have you along, empowered to contribute and build the things you want to make a reality.

People always ask **_Where do I go now? What do I do with all this new found knowledge?_**

Well, I've left some links with further resources above, but the best thing you can do for yourself is to take what you've learnt and **apply it**. Build something cool, contribute to GitHub Repos, participate in hackathons, apply for jobs. Make mistakes and learn as you go. A constant stream of tutorials will not reinforce the confidence in yourself and in your abilities necessary to succeed.
