### NFTs

Welcome back! In this section of the course we'll be investigate Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs), we'll learn what an NFT is, why they're so cool and how to create our very own NFTs, one basic and one advanced.

### Two Flavors

As mentioned, we'll be learning two approaches to simple NFT development in this course. This first will be a basic implementation using these cute puppies!

In this first basic implementation our images are going to be stored in [**IPFS**](https://ipfs.tech/).

With our second NFT, the art is going to be stored _on-chain_ and dynamic, changing based on a criteria we set, setting our mood from happy to sad or vice versa!

And, perhaps most excitingly, by the end of this section you'll have you're very own NFTs imported into your own wallet/metamask. You can also view them on service like OpenSea which will allow you to sell, trade, view and collect all sorts of NFTs!

### Wrap Up
