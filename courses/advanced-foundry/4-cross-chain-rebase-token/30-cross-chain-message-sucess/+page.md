## Verifying Your Cross-Chain Token Transfer with CCIP Explorer and MetaMask

Following the initiation of a cross-chain token transfer using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), the next crucial step is to verify its successful completion. This lesson guides you through verifying an optional cross-chain message, specifically a token transfer, using the CCIP Explorer and confirming token receipt in your wallet. We'll use the example of transferring a custom "Rebase Token" (RBT) from the Ethereum Sepolia testnet to the ZkSync Sepolia testnet.

**Confirming Success on the CCIP Explorer**

The primary tool for monitoring CCIP transactions is the CCIP Explorer (`ccip.chain.link`). Navigate to the transaction details page for your transfer.

1.  **Check the Status:** The most important field is "Status". Look for a green "Success" indicator. This confirms that the CCIP network has successfully processed your cross-chain message according to the protocol rules.
2.  **Identify Key Parameters:** Familiarize yourself with the essential details provided:
    *   **Message ID:** A unique identifier generated by CCIP for this specific cross-chain message.
    *   **Source Transaction Hash:** The transaction hash on the origin chain (Ethereum Sepolia in this case). Clicking this link typically directs you to the block explorer for the source chain (e.g., Etherscan for Sepolia).
    *   **Destination Transaction Hash:** The transaction hash on the destination chain (ZkSync Sepolia). This hash is generated *after* the message is successfully processed and executed on the destination chain. Clicking this link directs you to the destination chain's block explorer.
    *   **Source Chain:** Confirms the originating network (e.g., Ethereum Sepolia).
    *   **Destination Chain:** Confirms the target network (e.g., ZkSync Sepolia).

A "Success" status on the CCIP Explorer is the definitive confirmation that your tokens have been processed for transfer to the destination chain.

**Locating the Destination Token Contract Address**

To verify the token balance in your wallet on the destination chain, you first need the token's contract address *on that specific chain*. If you deployed a new token contract on the destination chain as part of the bridging process (common in "lock-and-mint" or "burn-and-mint" models), you'll need its address.

Often, this address is outputted during the deployment script execution. It's good practice to save deployed contract addresses immediately after deployment. If you didn't, you might need to scroll through your terminal history or deployment logs to find the address (e.g., looking for output like "ZkSync rebase token address: 0x..."). Copy this address once located.

*Note: The underlying smart contracts (like the `Pool.sol` example mentioned in the source material) often define data structures (`struct LockOrBurnInV1`, `struct LockOrBurnOutV1`) that handle the necessary data fields for CCIP token transfers, including source/destination token addresses, amounts, and chain selectors.*

**Verifying Token Receipt in MetaMask**

With the destination token contract address copied, you can now confirm the balance in your Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask):

1.  **Switch Network:** Open MetaMask and ensure you are connected to the correct destination network (ZkSync Sepolia Testnet in this example). You may need to add the network if you haven't used it before.
2.  **Import Token:** Navigate to the "Tokens" tab or asset list and select the option to "Import tokens".
3.  **Paste Address:** Paste the copied ZkSync Rebase Token contract address into the "Token contract address" field.
4.  **Auto-Detection:** MetaMask should automatically detect the Token Symbol (e.g., RBT) and Token Decimals (e.g., 18).
5.  **Confirm Balance:** *Before* finalizing the import, MetaMask often displays your current balance for that token. Even a minuscule, non-zero balance confirms the transfer was successful. Test transfers often use very small amounts to conserve testnet funds; the key is observing that *some* amount has arrived.
6.  **Finalize Import:** Click "Add custom token" or "Import". The token (RBT) will now appear in your asset list for the ZkSync Sepolia network, displaying the received balance.

**Analyzing Transaction Details in CCIP Explorer**

Returning to the CCIP Explorer transaction details page provides further insights:

*   **Tokens and Amounts:** Displays the specific token and amount transferred (e.g., RBT). Note that the explorer UI might sometimes round or truncate very small decimal amounts.
*   **Fees:** Shows the amount of LINK tokens paid to the CCIP network service providers for executing the cross-chain transaction. CCIP usage requires LINK payments.
*   **Origin/From/To:** Details the sender address on the source chain and the receiver address on the destination chain. In many test cases, these might be the same address.
*   **Sender Nonce:** This is a crucial field for message ordering. It indicates the sequence number of this specific CCIP message originating *from this sender address on this source chain*. For example, a nonce of `7` means this is the 7th CCIP message sent by this account from Ethereum Sepolia.
*   **Gas Limit:** This specifies the gas limit passed to the destination chain transaction execution. A value of `0` indicates that no extra computation or custom logic was requested on the destination chain beyond the standard token transfer (minting or unlocking). If you had implemented a custom `ccipReceive` function in your destination contract (to trigger specific actions upon message arrival), you would have specified a non-zero gas limit when sending the CCIP message to fund that execution.

**Understanding CCIP Token Enabling and Supported Lanes**

Successfully sending a token cross-chain relies on that token being *enabled* for CCIP on the relevant source and destination chains. This enabling process registers the token with the CCIP contracts, allowing users to transfer it via the protocol.

To discover which chains and tokens are supported and the available pathways (lanes) between them, consult the official **CCIP Directory** (`docs.chain.link/ccip/directory`).

The directory allows you to:
*   View all mainnet and testnet chains integrated with CCIP.
*   Select a specific chain to see its supported *outbound lanes* (chains it can send messages/tokens *to*) and *inbound lanes* (chains it can receive messages/tokens *from*). For example, exploring ZkSync mainnet might show supported lanes to and from Ethereum and Arbitrum One.

By successfully verifying your transaction on the CCIP Explorer and confirming token receipt in your wallet, you have completed a fundamental cross-chain operation using Chainlink CCIP. Understanding the details available on the explorer and knowing where to find supported network information in the CCIP Directory are key skills for building robust cross-chain applications.
