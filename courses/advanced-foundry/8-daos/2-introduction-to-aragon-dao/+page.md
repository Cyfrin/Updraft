### Aragon

In this lesson we're guided by Juliette Chevalier in the process of creating a DAO through Aragon using _no code_.

Begin by navigating to [**app.aragon.org**](https://app.aragon.org/). Once on the landing page you can connect a wallet and jump right into `Create your DAO`.

---

You should be met with a wonderful breakdown of the steps we'll take to create our DAO, select `Build your DAO` again to continue.

---

Next, you'll be asked to select a chain you expect to deploy on, with Sepolia available as a testnet.

---

Following this you'll be tasked with describing some details of the DAO, giving it a name, logo and personality. This is also where links to DAO socials would be included such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Discord etc.

Next is all about defining membership and who/how governance is allocated. In this stage you can decide the details of a new ERC20 governance token and to whom they are minted, or even import an existing token that the community can use.

---

From here, we need to define the specific, granular details pertaining to how governance and proposals are handled by the protocol. These details include the threshold needed for successful proposals, duration to vote, who can create proposals etc.

---

And finally, we need to verify our configurations before deployment! Importantly, all of our configurations can be adjusted after deployment with a successful proposal (with the exception of the blockchain we're deployed on).

And that's it! In less than 2 minutes you can have a functional DAO protocol deployed and ready to take proposals. Aragon even offers an on-platform dashboard to manage the DAO and oversee membership and engagement.

I highly encourage you to take a look at the service yourself!

Thanks Juliette!
