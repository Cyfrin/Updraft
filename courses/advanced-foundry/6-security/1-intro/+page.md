## Unraveling the Importance of Security with Stats

In case you're wondering why we're emphasizing security - the stats speak loud and clear! Here's a shocking fact:

To make it noir, consider the total value locked in the DEFI which was approximately $50 billion. That would indicate **6%** of all DFI was hacked last year. In simpler terms, it like placing your money in a bank that cheerfully says, "_Hey, there's a 6% chance all your money will be gone next year_".

The plausibility of this grim prospect closely mirrors what's happening in the crypto space and underlines the urgent need to bolster its security.

Take a glance at an intriguing leaderboard on _Rectit News_. It's a daunting lineup of some of the biggest hacks, many of which were born out of code that was unaudited or reviewed by security professionals. Moreover, some of these attacks led to staggering losses of over half a billion dollars.

This brings us to a fundamental decision for protocol devs -

From a business perspective, investing in security absolutely makes sense and provides a whopping 99% saving in costs.

## Beginning the Process with Smart Contract Audits

Protocol developers listen up! In all likelihood, you'll need to get a **smart contract security audit** at some point before you launch your protocol. That's where we'll start.

A smart contract audit is certainly worth watching even if you don't aspire to become an auditor yourself. It will provide you with a foundation understanding when your protocol is poised to launch to mainnet.
