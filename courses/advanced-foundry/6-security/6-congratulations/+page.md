# Becoming a Smart Contract Security Wizard: What’s Next After Your First Big Course

Welcome back, this is the end of our journey together, at least for this course. We hope you've enjoyed it and learned a lot. We've covered a lot of ground, and you should be proud of yourself for making it this far. Now, let's take a look at some nice tools and resources that will help you continue your journey.

## Resources That Cannot Be Missed

Continuing your journey through security education and fine-tuning those skills you just acquired is also essential:

- [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/), crafted by a developer named Tincho, is a fascinating game that draws you right into the heart of offensive security in Ethereum’s smart contracts.

- A kinetically engaging way of learning, [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) offers an immersive game-like environment perfect for understanding Solidity and smart contract vulnerabilities.

## For The Aesthetes: Insights into Smart Contract Auditing

One vital aspect of this space is auditing. If you're looking to be an auditor, [Solidit](https://solodit.xyz/) is an excellent tool for accessing audit reports from the most accomplished smart contract security professionals in the industry. Here at [Cyfrin](https://www.cyfrin.io/), we do smart contract security and auditing too, so don't hesitate to reach out.

## Sharpen Your Saw: Further Learning and Opportunities

Although we have dipped quite deep into the iceberg that is security in this course, you must understand that there's still so much more to explore, and we're working on providing further security-based education, so stay tuned. However, to kick things off in your advanced security journey.

This marks the end of the security lesson, but not of your journey. Now that you're armed with deep insights into the Web Three developer space, it might seem daunting to contemplate your next move. No worries though; here's the answer: apply your new knowledge. Whether you're joining a hackathon, delving into GitHub repos, or applying for jobs and grants, it's critical to utilize and develop your skills.

Thanks to all who took the course and contributed to its creation. It's been a thrill to share this journey, and the excitement continues as we watch you dive in, continue your learning, and march forward, building on the cutting-edge technology our field offers. We look forward to seeing you in the Web Three and blockchain community and can’t wait to admire the wonderful things you build. Until then, happy coding!

Bye!
