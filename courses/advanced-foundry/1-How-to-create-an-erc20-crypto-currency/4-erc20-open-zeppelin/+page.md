### ERC20 OpenZeppelin

Welcome back! As mentioned in the closing of our last lesson, we could absolutely continue with manually building out a smart contract comprised of all the required functions to be compatible with the ERC20 standard, but wouldn't it be more convenient to use pre-deployed, audited, and ready-to-go contracts?

In this section, I'll guide you on using the OpenZeppelin Library to achieve this.

> ❗ **NOTE**
> OpenZeppelin is renowned for its Smart Contract framework, offering a vast repository of audited contracts readily integrable into your codebase.

Access [OpenZeppelin's documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/) via their official website. By navigating to [Products -> Contracts Library](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts), you can discover a vast array of ready-to-use contracts.

Additionally, OpenZeppelin offers a contract wizard, streamlining the contract creation process — perfect for tokens, governances, or custom contracts.

Let's leverage OpenZeppelin to create a new ERC20 Token. Create a new file within `src` named `OurToken.sol`. Once that's done, let's install the OpenZeppelin library into our contract.

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
```

Once installed you'll see the ERC20 contract from OpenZeppelin within `lib/openzeppelin-contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol`. Let's add a remapping in our foundry.toml to make importing a little easier on us.Within foundry.toml add the line:

```toml
remappings = ["@openzeppelin=lib/openzeppelin-contracts"]
```

We can now import and inherit this contract into `OurToken.sol`!

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract OurToken is ERC20 {
    //constructor goes here
}
```

By importing the OpenZeppelin implementation of ERC20 this way, we inherit all the functionality of the ERC20 standard with much less work and a level of confidence that the code has been testing and verified.

> ❗ **PROTIP**
> If you're looking for an alternative library full of trusted contracts, I recommend looking at the [**Solmate Repo**](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate) by Transmissions11.

Now, we should recall that when inheriting from a contract with a constructor, our contract must fulfill the requirements of that constructor. We'll need to define details like a name and symbol for OurToken.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract OurToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("OurToken", "OT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
}
```

For the purposes of simple examples like this, I like to mint the initialSupply to the deployer/msg.sender, which I've demonstrated above.

As always we can perform a sanity check to assure things are working as expected by running `forge build`.

Nailed it.

See you in the next lesson where we'll look into how to deploy this bad Larry.
