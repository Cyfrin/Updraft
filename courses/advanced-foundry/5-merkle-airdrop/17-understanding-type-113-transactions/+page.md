**Account abstraction** is a concept that allows users' assets to be stored in **smart contracts** rather than externally owned accounts (EOAs).This feature is built directly in the ZKsync, and it's said that this chain has _native_ account abstraction.

On Ethereum, there are two types of accounts:

1. **externally owned accounts (EOAs)**, which require a public and private key pair and users have to sign/initiate their own transactions
2. **contract accounts**. These are smart contracts that behave as accounts but are also capable of implementing more complex logic. They enable features such as _multiple signers_ or allowing others to pay for gas and send transactions on our behalf.

> 🗒️ **NOTE**:br
> Accounts on ZKsync are automatically _smart contract_ accounts. They are fully customizable and include different signature schemes, multi-signature capabilities, and setting spending limits.
