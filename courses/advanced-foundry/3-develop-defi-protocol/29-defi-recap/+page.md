### DeFi Recap

Wow, we've done it. This project was enormous, advanced and frankly intense. You should 1000% push this to your GitHub repo and be incredibly proud of yourself for completing this journey.

This is one of the hardest and most complicated projects you'll find in educational content in Web3. We've learnt about:

- DeFi
- State of the art fuzz testing methodologies
- Safe use of oracles
- multifaceted test suites
- integration and deployment through scripts
  ...and more!

Since the filming of this course I've had the `DecentralizedStableCoin` protocol audited on `CodeHawks`. You can find the [**audit report for the contest here**](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/cljx3b9390009liqwuedkn0m0).

I encourage you to dive into the findings submitted by the Hawks, if security or auditing is your end goal, this kind of review and research will be invaluable.

After all of this, you know what time it is: **BREAK TIME**. You deserve it, and when you come back there'll be a tonne more content to move onto next.

We have 3 lessons remaining in this section, and they'll be a breeze compared to this one.

See you soon!
