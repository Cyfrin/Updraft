### Lens Protocol

As a **_bonus_** bit of content I wanted to take a minute to express my support for the `Aave protocol` and the `Aave team` by highlighting one of the amazing products/services they're bringing to the Web3 space.

`Lens Protocols` is a decentralized social layer/platform which empowers users to create social applications, or implement social features into their existing applications.

You can imagine the already widely adopted features and functionality of contemporary social media platforms merged seamlessly with the features of Web3 such as native payments and composability.

At it's core, `Lens` allows developers to extend smart contract functionality in ways similar to API requests on popular social platforms in Web2.

If you're interested in getting started with `Lens` or deploying a protocol on `Lens` on your own, take a look at the [**Lens Documentation**](https://www.lens.xyz/docs) for further information and how to get started.

See you all in the next lesson!
