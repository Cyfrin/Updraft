### Audit Prep

We talked a little bit earlier about what a `smart contract audit` is, but we haven't gone into much detail. This is saved largely for the [**Security Course**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/security) we've releases since this course, and I encourage you to jump into it next now that you're a Foundry Master!

However, in brief, a great place you can look to get a sense of a protocol's audit readiness is this [**Audit Readiness Checklist**](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/audit-readiness-checklist.md) from Nascentxyz.

Beyond this, those who are really serious about launching a protocol, be sure to reach the final lesson of this section on `Smart Contract Security`. It's there we will go a little more low-level from a developer perspective and delve into how we can protect ourselves from common attack vectors.

With that said, let's recap everything we've gone over in the next lesson!
