### Recap

You've just learnt how to employ an incredibly powerful tool in blockchain development. Upgradeability in an immutable world is incredibly useful and enticing.

BUT. I'm going to again caution you against defaulting to this sort of methodology. The centrality baked into the ability to upgrade smart contract protocols has burnt the industry time and time again, so please use proxies sparingly.

With that said, if you would like to watch a live demo of this process (on a testnet), I'll direct you to the video portion of this section. You needn't follow along, but if you'd like to see the process from beginning to end, I encourage you to watch.

Now's a great time to take a break. You've certainly earned it. We have 2 more sections on Governance and Security that remain!
