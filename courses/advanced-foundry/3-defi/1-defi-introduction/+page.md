# Diving into Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Hello and welcome back. Today we will be delving into Foundry DeFi, taking a look at the code we will be working with throughout this course. It is important to mention that DeFi is an enormous and complex subject that fully deserves an exclusive course, but for now, let's start by delving into the basics of DeFi. Letâ€™s get started!

## I. An Overview of DeFi

If you are new to DeFi, a great starting point is [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/), a simple and intuitive website that provides a current snapshot of the DeFi industry, giving insights into total value locked in DeFi, leading apps, and dominant protocols. Top platforms include open-source decentralized banking like Aave, liquid staking platforms like Lido, decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Curve Finance, and collateralized debt position protocols like MakerDAO which we will be building later in the course.

### The Beauty of DeFi

The beauty of DeFi and the reason for its growing popularity is the access it provides to sophisticated financial products and instruments in a decentralized context.

In my opinion, DeFi is possibly the most exciting and important application of smart contracts. I highly recommend spending some time to become conversant with the basics of DeFi, if not becoming fully fluent. Start with useful resources such as the [Bankless](https://www.bankless.com/) podcast and [MetaMask Learn](https://learn.metamask.io/).

## II. Getting Started with DeFi

I encourage you to begin by playing around with apps such as Aave and Uniswap on their respective websites.

For newcomers, it is advisable to start on testnets. Some platforms, such as Ethereum, have high transaction fees, so beginners might want to consider cheaper alternatives like Polygon Optimism or Arbitrum.

It's crucial to remain aware of the concept of MEV (Miner Extractable Value or Maximal Extractable Value) which is a significant issue in the DeFi industry. In essence, if you are a validator who arranges transactions in a block, you can organize them in a manner that favors you - cultivating fair practices in this area is the focus of several protocols like Flashbots.

For those looking to delve deeper into DeFi, I recommend checking out the [Flashbots.net](https://www.flashbots.net/) website, which houses a wealth of videos and blogs.

## III. The Project: Building A Stablecoin

In this course, we will be building our version of a stablecoin. The concept of stablecoins is advanced and widely misunderstood. To simplify it, they are assets that peg their market value to another stable asset, like gold or a fiat currency.

## IV. Foundry Stablecoin Project is the Most Advanced.

Even though we have following lessons on upgrades, governance, introduction to security, this Foundry Stablecoin project is the most advanced one we're working with, hands down.

Stepping into DeFi and understanding everything in this lesson can be a daunting task. Seek help from [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/), use the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23/) discussion tab or even browse the [MakerDAO forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/) to understand how the industry stalwarts are working and implementing DeFi.

You can even check out Coinbase's educational content to get a headstart on DeFi.
