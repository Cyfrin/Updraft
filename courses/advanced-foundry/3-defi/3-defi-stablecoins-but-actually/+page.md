# Everything You Need to Know About Stablecoins

## Introduction

Stablecoins have become one of the most talked about topics in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. However, there is a lot of misleading information out there about what stablecoins really are and how they work. This blog post will provide a comprehensive overview of stablecoins, clarifying common misconceptions and providing key details that every crypto enthusiast should understand.

We'll cover what stablecoins are, why they matter, different categories and properties of stablecoins, designs of top stablecoins like Dai and USDC, and most importantly - the real incentives behind stablecoin creation and usage. There's a lot of ground to cover, so let's dive in!

## What Are Stablecoins?

A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to have minimal volatility and maintain a stable value over time. The key property of a stablecoin is that its "buying power" remains relatively constant.

For example, if 1 ETH could buy 10 apples last year but this year 1 ETH can only buy 5 apples due to ETH volatility, we would say ETH's buying power changed significantly. However, if $1 could buy 1 apple last year and $1 can still buy 1 apple today, the dollar's buying power remained stable.

Stablecoins aim to mimic the stability of fiat currencies like the dollar, while still retaining the benefits of cryptocurrencies like decentralization and security. A more formal definition is:

Unlike most cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar or algorithmically controlled via supply and demand to maintain stability.

## Why Do Stablecoins Matter?

Stablecoins fulfill 3 key functions of money that are needed for an efficient economy:

1. **Store of value**: Allow people to preserve wealth over time.
2. **Unit of account**: Provide a common measure of value to price goods and services.
3. **Medium of exchange**: Enable transactions between parties via a payment method.

For crypto to become a mature asset class and decentralized ecosystem, it requires stable assets that can reliably perform these functions without volatility. Fiat currencies like the US dollar serve these roles in traditional finance.

Stablecoins allow decentralized protocols to have access to price stability and a reliable medium of exchange - unlocking use cases like decentralized lending, payments, and more.

## Categorizing Stablecoins

There are 3 key ways to categorize different types of stablecoins:

### 1. Relative Stability

- **Pegged (anchored) stablecoins**: Pegged to the value of another asset like the US dollar. Examples include USDC, Tether.
- **Floating (unpegged) stablecoins**: Not pegged to any external asset. Stability is maintained via supply and demand mechanisms. Example: RYE stablecoin.

### 2. Stability Mechanism

- **Algorithmic**: Stability is maintained programmatically via a decentralized algorithm. Examples: DAI, Frax.
- **Governed (centralized)**: Stability is controlled manually by a central party. Examples: USDC, Tether.

### 3. Collateral Type

- **Exogenous**: Collateral comes from outside the stablecoin's ecosystem. If stablecoin fails, collateral is unaffected. Examples: DAI (ETH collateral), USDC (USD fiat collateral).
- **Endogenous**: Collateral comes from inside the stablecoin's ecosystem. If stablecoin fails, collateral fails too. Example: TerraUSD (LUNA collateral).

## Top Stablecoin Designs

Now let's look at some top stablecoins and their key design properties:

### DAI

Properties:

- Pegged to USD
- Algorithmic
- Exogenous collateral (overcollateralized ETH)

DAI is one of the most influential DeFi stablecoins. Users deposit ETH as collateral to mint DAI stablecoins against it. Unique stability fees discourage excessive printing. Autonomous smart contracts maintain the peg and collateralization ratio.

### USDC

Properties:

- Pegged to USD
- Governed (centralized)
- Exogenous collateral (USD fiat reserves in bank accounts)

USDC is a popular stablecoin back 1:1 by US dollar reserves. It is controlled by a consortium of centralized entities that manage the reserves.

### TerraUSD (UST)

Properties:

- Formerly pegged to USD
- Algorithmic
- Endogenous collateral (LUNA tokens)

UST relied on algorithmic mechanisms to maintain its peg to the US dollar. Its stability was dependent on LUNA, whose value collapsed along with UST. This shows the risks of endogenous collateral.

### RYE

Properties:

- Floating (not pegged)
- Algorithmic
- Exogenous collateral (ETH)

RYE uses supply and demand mechanisms to algorithmically maintain stability relative to purchasing power. It is one of the few prominent non-pegged stablecoins on the market today.

## The Real Purpose of Stablecoins

At this point you may be wondering - if stablecoins are supposed to enable decentralized payments and commerce, why are they being printed in the billions?

The truth is, the primary users and beneficiaries of today's stablecoins are not average crypto users transacting in a decentralized economy. **The key demand for stablecoins actually comes from wealthy crypto investors seeking to amplify their holdings through leveraged trading strategies.**

Most DeFi protocols allow users to deposit cryptoassets like ETH as collateral to take out stablecoin loans, often at attractive interest rates. Investors can then use these stablecoins to buy more ETH and increase their position size.

Essentially, stablecoins unlock amplified exposure to volatile cryptoassets - also known as leverage. With the ability to go 2-3x leverage on their holdings via stablecoin loans, large crypto investors can maximize returns in bull markets.

And because stablecoin systems charge fees for minting, they earn a nice revenue stream from traders pursuing these leveraged strategies.

**So while stablecoins are marketed as bringing stability and usability to decentralized finance, the reality is speculative leverage is driving most of the growth in stablecoins today.**

## Conclusion

This covers the key essentials you need to know about stablecoins. To recap:

- Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value.
- They bring stability and usability to decentralized finance.
- But leverage and speculation are big drivers of stablecoin demand today.

There are still many open questions about the ideal stablecoin design and governance model. I'm excited to see how stablecoin technology and applications continue to evolve in years to come!
