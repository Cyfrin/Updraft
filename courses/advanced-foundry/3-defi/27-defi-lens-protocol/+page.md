# Understanding Lens Protocol - The Decentralized Social Layer of Web3

Hello everyone, in today's section we are delving into the trenches of protocols that are not just pushing the envelope, but actively redefining the possibilities of the Web3 community. I absolutely <3 the Aave Protocol and the Aave team's consistent efforts in delivering protocols, products, and services that are enhancing the Web3 space.

One such noteworthy protocol is the Lens Protocol. Noted as a decentralized social platform, it enables building social media applications in the decentralized space. To provide a detailed overview of the Lens Protocol, we have Nader Dabit, the head of DevRel for Lens Protocol at the Aave team.

## Embracing Web3 with Lens Protocol

Hello folks! I'm Nader Dabit, walking you through a quick introduction of Lens Protocol and its relevance to you as a smart contract or solidity engineer.

Lens, the social layer of Web3, equips developers with the power to construct social applications or include social features in their current applications. With a whopping 4.9 billion users globally using social applications, it is a feature widely recognized and valued.

These applications open the gateway to numerous value propositions, enabling developers to tap and exploit the opportunities they present. When combined with Web3 features like native payments, ownership, and composability, it elevates the potential to new heights offering much more robustness when compared to traditional social applications or infrastructure.

## Expanding the Horizons with Custom Modules

Lens allows developers to expand the core smart contracts by developing their custom modules. Imagine if Twitter, Instagram, or other social applications allowed developers to submit pull requests into their backends and APIs. This ability instigates a lot of captivating and potent functionality, inspiring developers to integrate innovative ideas into their applications, and branch out into other aspects of Web3 like DeFi.

Moreover, Lens Smart Contracts can be invoked from other smart contracts. This flexibility facilitates developers aiming to build something composable with the Web3 social graph, making Lens an excellent platform to integrate.

## Get On Board: Start Building on Lens

For those eager to get their hands dirty and start building on Lens, head over to the [Lens Documentation](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs). Don't forget to explore ways to deploy the protocol independently, get a closer look at the smart contract code, and fiddle around with it. Learn about creating and building your custom modules.

Stay tuned for more exciting insights and updates. Until next time, happy coding!
