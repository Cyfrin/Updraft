# Preparing for Your Smart Contract Audit: A Comprehensive Guide

In the vast and rapidly evolving world of smart contracts, security is paramount. While the course encompasses various aspects of smart contract development, one topic that we've briefly touched upon, but warrants a closer, more focused discussion is that of **smart contract audits**. While we've yet to delve deep into the details of security, this section aims to provide some guidance on preparing for smart contract audits.

## What Are Smart Contract Audits?

A smart contract audit involves thorough scrutinizing of the smart contract's codebase to identify potential security vulnerabilities, errors, or violation of best practices. Think of it as a rigorous debugging process that goes beyond just identifying errors — it ensures the robustness of your smart contract by checking that it functions as expected without any security threats.
