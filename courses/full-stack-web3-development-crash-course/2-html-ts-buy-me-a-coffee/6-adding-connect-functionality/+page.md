## Connecting Your Dapp: Adding a Web3 Wallet Button with JavaScript and Viem

This lesson guides you through adding a "Connect Wallet" button to a basic HTML page. We'll start with fundamental JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling, then check for a browser wallet like MetaMask, and finally use the modern `viem` library to robustly handle the connection process.

## Initial Setup and Selecting the Button

First, ensure you have a basic HTML file (`index.html`) and a JavaScript file (`index-js.js`) linked together. Your HTML needs a button element we can interact with.

**`index.html`:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Connect Button Lesson</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="connectButton">Connect</button>
    <script src="index-js.js" type="module"></script> <!-- type="module" is needed for imports -->
</body>
</html>
```

Now, in your `index-js.js` file, we need to get a reference to this button using JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) API. The `document` object represents your HTML page, and its methods allow us to find and manipulate elements.

**`index-js.js`:**
```javascript
const connectButton = document.getElementById('connectButton');
```
This code uses `document.getElementById` to find the HTML element with the ID "connectButton" and stores a reference to it in the constant `connectButton`. We can now use this variable to control the button's behavior.

## Adding Basic Click Functionality

To make the button interactive, we attach an event listener. Specifically, we'll define a function to run whenever the button is clicked.

**`index-js.js`:**
```javascript
// Get the button element (from previous step)
const connectButton = document.getElementById('connectButton');

// Define the function to run on click
function connect() {
  console.log("Button clicked!"); // Simple log to test
}

// Assign the function to the button's onclick event
connectButton.onclick = connect;
```
Here, we define a function named `connect`. For now, it just logs a message to the browser's developer console. We then assign this `connect` function to the `onclick` property of our `connectButton` element. Now, every time the button is clicked in the browser, the `connect` function will execute, and you'll see "Button clicked!" in the console.

## Checking for MetaMask (or Similar Wallets)

Before attempting to connect a wallet, we must check if one is available in the user's browser environment. Ethereum wallets like MetaMask inject a global JavaScript object, typically `window.ethereum`, into the browser. We can check for its existence.

Let's modify the `connect` function:

**`index-js.js`:**
```javascript
const connectButton = document.getElementById('connectButton');

function connect() {
  // Check if window.ethereum is present
  if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {
    // Wallet is likely installed
    console.log("MetaMask (or compatible wallet) is available!");
    // We'll add connection logic here later
  } else {
    // Wallet is not installed
    console.log("No wallet detected.");
    connectButton.innerHTML = "Please install MetaMask!"; // Update button text
  }
}

connectButton.onclick = connect;
```
Inside `connect`, we use `typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined"` to see if the `ethereum` object exists on the `window`. If it does, we log a success message (for now). If it doesn't, we log a different message and update the button's text (`innerHTML`) to prompt the user to install a wallet. Test this in browsers with and without MetaMask installed to see the difference.

## Introducing Wallet Abstraction with Viem

While directly using `window.ethereum` works for basic checks and connections with MetaMask-compatible wallets, it's often better to use a wallet abstraction library. These libraries provide a standardized way to interact with various types of wallets and blockchain functionalities, making your code more robust, maintainable, and compatible with different wallet providers.

Two popular choices are `ethers.js` and `viem`. We'll use `viem` (`viem.sh`) for this tutorial due to its modern design, type safety, and lightweight nature.

Instead of installing `viem` via `npm` (common in larger projects), we'll import it directly from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) using an ES Module import, which works well for simple HTML/JS setups. Make sure your `<script>` tag in `index.html` has `type="module"`.

**`index-js.js`:**
```javascript
// Import necessary functions from viem via CDN
import { createWalletClient, custom } from "https://esm.sh/viem";

const connectButton = document.getElementById('connectButton');

// Declare walletClient variable outside the function
// so it can be potentially accessed elsewhere if needed
let walletClient;

function connect() {
  if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {
    console.log("MetaMask (or compatible wallet) is available!");
    // Connection logic using viem will go here
  } else {
    console.log("No wallet detected.");
    connectButton.innerHTML = "Please install MetaMask!";
  }
}

connectButton.onclick = connect;
```
We import `createWalletClient` (to create an interface for wallet actions) and `custom` (to specify how to communicate with the wallet) from `viem`.

## Connecting the Wallet using Viem

Now, let's use `viem` inside our `if` block to handle the actual connection request.

In `viem`, we create a `WalletClient`. This client needs a "Transport" to define *how* it communicates. Since we want to use the browser's injected wallet (MetaMask), we use the `custom` transport configured with `window.ethereum`.

Once we have the client, we can call its `requestAddresses` method. This method corresponds to the standard `eth_requestAccounts` RPC call, which prompts the user to connect their wallet.

**`index-js.js` (inside the `connect` function's `if` block):**
```javascript
    // Inside the 'if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined")' block:
    console.log("Connecting using viem...");

    // Create a Wallet Client
    walletClient = createWalletClient({
      transport: custom(window.ethereum) // Use the browser's injected provider
    });

    // Request wallet connection (account addresses)
    walletClient.requestAddresses();

    console.log("Connection request sent..."); // This logs too early! (See next section)
    connectButton.innerHTML = "Connected!"; // This updates too early!
```
If you run this code and click connect, MetaMask *will* pop up asking for permission. However, you'll notice the console logs "Connection request sent..." and the button text changes to "Connected!" *immediately*, even before you interact with the MetaMask pop-up. This happens because `requestAddresses` is an asynchronous operation.

## Handling Asynchronicity with `async`/`await`

Wallet interactions and network requests are asynchronous: they don't block the rest of your code while waiting for a response (like user confirmation in MetaMask). They return a `Promise`, which represents a future result.

To make our code wait for the asynchronous operation to complete before proceeding, we use the `async` and `await` keywords.

1.  Mark the function containing the asynchronous call as `async`.
2.  Use the `await` keyword before the asynchronous call (`walletClient.requestAddresses()`).

**`index-js.js` (Refactored `connect` function):**
```javascript
import { createWalletClient, custom } from "https://esm.sh/viem";

const connectButton = document.getElementById('connectButton');
let walletClient;

// Make the function async
async function connect() {
  if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {
    console.log("Connecting...");

    walletClient = createWalletClient({
      transport: custom(window.ethereum),
    });

    try {
      // Wait for the user to connect their wallet
      const addresses = await walletClient.requestAddresses();
      console.log("Connected accounts:", addresses); // Log the connected address(es)

      // This code now runs ONLY AFTER the await completes successfully
      connectButton.innerHTML = `Connected: ${addresses[0].slice(0, 6)}...`; // Show part of address
      console.log("Connection successful!");

    } catch (error) {
      // Handle errors, like the user rejecting the connection
      console.error("Connection failed:", error);
      connectButton.innerHTML = "Connect"; // Reset button text on failure
    }

  } else {
    connectButton.innerHTML = "Please install MetaMask!";
  }
}

connectButton.onclick = connect;
```
Now, when `connect` is called:
1.  It checks for `window.ethereum`.
2.  It creates the `walletClient`.
3.  It hits `await walletClient.requestAddresses()`. The function execution *pauses* here.
4.  MetaMask (or the relevant wallet) prompts the user.
5.  If the user approves, the `Promise` returned by `requestAddresses` resolves, `await` gets the result (an array of addresses), and execution continues. The button text is updated, and success is logged.
6.  If the user rejects or an error occurs, the `catch` block executes, logging the error and resetting the button text.

## Important Considerations

*   **Brave Shields:** If using the Brave browser, ensure "Shields" are down for your development environment (e.g., `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`) as they can sometimes interfere with wallet detection and interaction.
*   **Asynchronicity is Crucial:** Understanding `async`/`await` and Promises is fundamental in web3, as nearly all interactions with wallets and blockchains are asynchronous.
*   **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block is essential for a good user experience. Always handle potential errors, such as the user cancelling the connection request.
*   **Viem Benefits:** Using `viem` provides type safety, better abstraction, and helper functions compared to directly using `window.ethereum`, making development smoother, especially for more complex applications.

You have now successfully implemented a "Connect Wallet" button that uses modern JavaScript and the `viem` library to interact with browser-based Ethereum wallets.
