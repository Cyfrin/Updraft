## Define Your 'Why': Setting Your Intention for This Course

Before we dive into the technical details and start writing code, let's address a fundamental question: Why are you taking this course? Pause for a moment, open your notes file (`README.md`), and prepare to articulate your personal reasons for embarking on this journey.

Software engineering is inherently challenging, even with the advanced tools and AI assistance available today. The blockchain space elevates this difficulty significantly. You're entering one of the most adversarial digital environments on the planet, where security isn't just a feature—it's paramount.

Consider the critical role of security, especially for web applications interacting with blockchain protocols. A lapse can have devastating consequences. For instance, vulnerabilities in a project's *website* have led to staggering losses, such as massive hacks attributed to sophisticated actors exploiting web-facing weaknesses. This underscores that even with cutting-edge blockchain technology, weaknesses in related web infrastructure can be catastrophic. Getting this right demands skill, diligence, and a deep understanding of potential threats.

Learning complex skills takes time and effort. There will inevitably be moments in this course where you feel stuck, frustrated, or tired. This is where your 'Why' becomes crucial. We want you to create a rock-solid list of your personal motivations right now in your `README.md` file. This list will serve as your anchor. When you're facing challenges or considering taking a break, revisiting these reasons will provide the resilience and drive needed to push through and stay committed.

The most vital aspects of this exercise are honesty and specificity. Be completely honest with yourself about what drives you. Avoid vague statements. If your goal is financial, define it: instead of just 'I want to be rich,' write something concrete like 'I aim to achieve a $100k salary within two years' or 'My target is a $200k salary in two years.' If your motivation is personal, like 'I want a better life for my family,' specify who you are doing this for: 'My wife, my sister, my brother, my parents.' Perhaps your drive is passion-based: 'I want to be part of shaping the future with blockchain technology.'

Structure your thoughts under a clear heading in your `README.md`, like this:

```markdown
# Why?

- I want to be rich
- I want to have a $100k salary in 2 years
- I want to have a $200k salary in 2 years
- I want a better life for my family
- My wife, my sister, my brother, my parents
- I want to be a part of history in this amazing blockchain industry
```

For an extra layer of motivation, consider adding what might happen if you *don't* complete this course or achieve your goals. What are the consequences of remaining on your current path? Sometimes, understanding what you want to avoid can be as powerful as knowing what you want to achieve.

So, take the time *now*. Pause this lesson and create your list in your `README.md` file. Make a commitment to revisit this list whenever you feel challenged or lose momentum. Life happens, and focus can waver, but your 'Why' can bring you back. Consider reviewing and updating this list periodically—perhaps every six months or year—as your goals and perspective evolve.

Understand *why* you must see this through. Once you've documented your reasons, you'll be better prepared mentally and emotionally for the learning journey ahead. Then, you can proceed with the rest of the course.
