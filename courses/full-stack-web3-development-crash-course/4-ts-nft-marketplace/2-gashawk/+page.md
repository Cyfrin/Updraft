## Understanding High Ethereum Gas Fees

Interacting with the Ethereum Mainnet often involves transaction fees, commonly known as "gas." These fees can fluctuate significantly based on network demand, sometimes becoming prohibitively expensive. Paying high gas fees can deter users from performing actions like swapping tokens, minting NFTs, or interacting with DeFi protocols.

## Introducing GasHawk: Your Partner for Gas Savings

GasHawk is a service designed specifically to address the challenge of high and volatile Ethereum gas fees. It acts as an intelligent layer between your wallet and the Ethereum network, aiming to execute your transactions at more favourable, lower gas prices, ultimately saving you money.

## How GasHawk Optimizes Your Transactions

GasHawk employs a sophisticated approach to minimize your gas costs. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1.  **Prediction Models:** GasHawk utilizes predictive models to forecast periods when Ethereum network congestion is likely to decrease, leading to lower base gas fees.
2.  **Strategic Execution:** Instead of broadcasting your transaction immediately (when gas might be high), GasHawk aims to submit it during predicted low-fee windows. It seeks the "lowest base fee over any time interval," allowing you to specify a time sensitivity for your transaction.
3.  **RPC Proxy:** You don't send your transaction directly to the standard Ethereum network nodes. Instead, you configure your wallet (like MetaMask) to use GasHawk's custom Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoint. When you initiate a transaction, your *signed* transaction is sent securely to the GasHawk RPC proxy. GasHawk then holds this transaction and submits it to the actual Ethereum network when its system identifies an optimal, low-gas moment within your potential time constraints.

This mechanism involves a trade-off: you gain potential cost savings in exchange for potentially slightly delayed execution compared to immediate broadcasting via a standard RPC.

## Setting Up GasHawk with MetaMask

Integrating GasHawk into your workflow is straightforward, primarily involving adding its custom RPC endpoint to your MetaMask wallet.

1.  **Navigate to GasHawk:** Open your web browser and go to the GasHawk application dashboard: `app.gashawk.io`.
2.  **Connect Wallet:** Connect your MetaMask wallet to the GasHawk application by following the on-screen prompts.
3.  **Add GasHawk Network:** Within the GasHawk dashboard (e.g., under `app.gashawk.io/#/dashboard/tx`), locate and select the option to add the "GasHawk Ethereum" network configuration to your wallet.
4.  **Approve in MetaMask:** MetaMask will pop up, requesting permission to "Update Ethereum Mainnet." This doesn't replace the original Mainnet settings but adds GasHawk as an *alternative* RPC provider for the Mainnet.
5.  **Review Details:** MetaMask will display the details of the network being added, including the crucial **Network URL (RPC URL):**
    ```
    https://core.gashawk.io/rpc/1
    ```
    It will also show standard warnings about trusting custom RPC providers, as they can potentially see your IP address, account address, and broadcast transactions on your behalf (using your signature).
6.  **Confirm Addition:** Click "Approve" in the MetaMask prompts to finalize adding the GasHawk RPC endpoint. You might need to approve multiple steps.

## Using GasHawk for Everyday Transactions

Once the GasHawk RPC is added, activating it for your transactions is simple:

1.  **Open MetaMask:** Access your MetaMask wallet extension.
2.  **Select Network Settings:** Ensure "Ethereum Mainnet" is the selected network. Click on the network selector dropdown.
3.  **Choose GasHawk RPC:** You should now see multiple RPC URL options listed for Ethereum Mainnet, including your previous default (e.g., "Infura") and the newly added "GasHawk Ethereum Mainnet" associated with `core.gashawk.io/rpc/1`. Select the GasHawk RPC URL.
4.  **Transact Normally:** With the GasHawk RPC selected, you can now use your wallet and interact with dApps as you normally would. Any transactions you initiate while connected to this RPC will be routed through GasHawk's optimization system.

## Key Considerations When Using GasHawk

*   **Cost vs. Speed:** Remember that GasHawk prioritizes lower gas costs. This means your transactions might take slightly longer to confirm on the blockchain compared to sending them immediately via a standard RPC during potentially higher fee periods.
*   **Trust:** As MetaMask warns, only add RPC endpoints from providers you trust. GasHawk acts as an intermediary for your transactions, so ensure you are comfortable with their service handling the final submission of your signed transactions to the network.

## Beyond Basic Transactions: Additional GasHawk Features

GasHawk offers more than just optimizing standard wallet transactions:

*   **Chrome Extension:** A browser extension is available to help you easily track the status and savings of your GasHawk-processed transactions.
*   **Safe{Wallet} Integration:** GasHawk supports optimizing transactions initiated from Safe wallets (formerly Gnosis Safe), beneficial for teams and DAOs.
*   **Contract Deployment:** You can leverage GasHawk to potentially save significant costs when deploying new smart contracts to the Ethereum Mainnet.
