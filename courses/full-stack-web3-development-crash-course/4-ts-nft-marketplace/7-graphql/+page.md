## Connecting Indexed Blockchain Data to Your Frontend

In modern Web3 applications, efficiently displaying blockchain data on a frontend is crucial. Directly querying the blockchain for historical information like NFT listings or sales is often slow and resource-intensive. This is where blockchain indexers like Rindexer shine. Having previously set up Rindexer to listen for smart contract events (`ItemListed`, `ItemBought`, `ItemCanceled`) and store them in a PostgreSQL database, our next step is to bridge this indexed data to our Next.js frontend, specifically to display recently listed NFTs on our marketplace homepage.

## Introducing the Rindexer GraphQL API

Rindexer simplifies data retrieval by automatically providing a GraphQL API alongside its indexing service. When you run Rindexer using the command `rindexer start all`, it not only starts the indexer process but also spins up a GraphQL server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3001/graphql` by default.

GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients (like our Next.js frontend) to request *exactly* the data they need, and nothing more. This contrasts with traditional REST APIs, which often return fixed data structures, potentially leading to over-fetching or requiring multiple requests. Rindexer generates the GraphQL schema automatically based on the events you've configured it to index, making your indexed data readily available through this structured API.

## Exploring the Schema with the GraphQL Playground

Before writing frontend code, it's essential to understand the structure of the data available through the GraphQL API. Rindexer provides an invaluable tool for this: the GraphQL Playground. Access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3001/playground` in your browser while the Rindexer GraphQL server is running (`rindexer start all`).

The Playground offers several key features:

1.  **Interactive Query Building:** You can write GraphQL queries directly in the left panel and execute them against your live indexed data by pressing the "Play" button. The results appear in the middle panel.
2.  **Schema Exploration:** The "Schema" tab on the right allows you to inspect the complete GraphQL schema. You can browse available queries, mutations (if any), and data types, including all the fields defined for your indexed events. Viewing the Schema Definition Language (SDL) provides a concise, textual representation of the entire API structure, which is useful for understanding data relationships and even for providing context to AI code generation tools.
3.  **Documentation:** Auto-generated documentation for each field and type is often available directly within the schema browser.

Let's try a basic query to fetch listed items:

```graphql
query MyFirstQuery {
  allItemListeds { # Query generated by Rindexer for ItemListed events
    nodes {        # Access the list of results
      nftAddress   # Request the NFT contract address
      tokenId      # Request the token ID
      price        # Request the listing price
      seller       # Request the seller's address
    }
  }
}
```

Executing this in the Playground will return a JSON object containing a list (`nodes`) of the listed items with the specified fields, pulled directly from your indexed PostgreSQL data. Experimenting here helps you confirm data availability and refine your queries before integrating them into your application.

## Crafting a Query for Actively Listed NFTs

Our goal is to display NFTs that are currently listed for sale. This means we need not only the `ItemListed` events but also information about whether those items were subsequently bought or canceled. We can fetch all this related data efficiently in a single GraphQL request.

We'll construct a query that:
1.  Fetches the most recent `ItemListed` events, ordered by block number and transaction index.
2.  Fetches all `ItemBought` events.
3.  Fetches all `ItemCanceled` events.

The frontend will later use this combined data to filter out listed items that also appear in the bought or canceled lists for the same `nftAddress` and `tokenId`.

Here's the GraphQL query we'll use, stored in a TypeScript constant:

```typescript
const GET_RECENT_NFTS = `
  query GetMarketplaceData {
    # Fetch the latest 20 listed items, newest first
    allItemListeds(first: 20, orderBy: [BLOCK_NUMBER_DESC, TX_INDEX_DESC]) {
      nodes {
        rindexerId      # Unique ID from Rindexer
        seller
        nftAddress
        price
        tokenId
        contractAddress # Smart contract emitting the event
        txHash
        blockNumber
      }
    }
    # Fetch all cancellation events (for filtering)
    allItemCanceleds { # Matches the event name indexed by Rindexer
      nodes {
        nftAddress
        tokenId
      }
    }
    # Fetch all purchase events (for filtering)
    allItemBoughts { # Matches the event name indexed by Rindexer
      nodes {
        tokenId
        nftAddress
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

This query fetches the 20 most recent listings (`first: 20`, `orderBy: [BLOCK_NUMBER_DESC, TX_INDEX_DESC]`) along with *all* cancellation and purchase events. We fetch all bought/canceled events because a recently listed item could have been canceled or bought in a much older transaction if it was listed previously. Note the specific query names like `allItemListeds`, `allItemCanceleds`, `allItemBoughts` are generated by Rindexer based on your event names. You can confirm these exact names in the GraphQL Playground's schema explorer.

## Proxying GraphQL Requests in Next.js

To avoid hardcoding the Rindexer GraphQL endpoint (`http://localhost:3001/graphql`) directly in our frontend code and to manage different URLs for development and production environments, we can use Next.js's built-in rewrite functionality. This acts as a proxy.

Modify your `next.config.js` (or `next.config.ts`) file to include a rewrite rule:

```javascript
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  // ... other configurations
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/graphql', // The path your frontend will use
        destination: process.env.GRAPHQL_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001/graphql', // The actual Rindexer GraphQL endpoint
      },
    ];
  },
  // ... other configurations
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

This configuration tells Next.js that any request made from the frontend to `/api/graphql` should be forwarded to the URL specified in the `GRAPHQL_API_URL` environment variable, or fallback to `http://localhost:3001/graphql` if the variable isn't set. Now, our frontend components can consistently fetch data from `/api/graphql` regardless of the underlying backend location. Remember to restart your Next.js development server after changing this configuration.

## Fetching GraphQL Data in a React Component

With the query defined and the proxy set up, we can now create a function within our frontend codebase (e.g., near the `RecentlyListed.tsx` component) to actually fetch the data. We'll use the standard browser `fetch` API.

```typescript
async function fetchNFTs() { // We'll add type safety next
  const response = await fetch('/api/graphql', { // Target the proxied endpoint
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json', // Essential for GraphQL
      'Accept': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: GET_RECENT_NFTS, // Pass our defined GraphQL query string
      // variables: {} // Add if your query uses GraphQL variables
    }),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    // Handle HTTP errors (e.g., network issues, server errors)
    console.error("HTTP Error:", response.status, response.statusText);
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }

  const jsonResponse = await response.json();

  if (jsonResponse.errors) {
      // Handle GraphQL errors (e.g., syntax errors in the query)
      console.error("GraphQL Errors:", jsonResponse.errors);
      throw new Error(`GraphQL error: ${jsonResponse.errors.map((e: any) => e.message).join(', ')}`);
  }

  return jsonResponse; // Return the parsed JSON data (contains a 'data' key)
}
```

This asynchronous function sends a POST request to our proxied endpoint `/api/graphql`. The GraphQL query is sent within the `body` of the request, structured as a JSON object with a `query` key. The function parses the JSON response and includes basic error handling for both HTTP and GraphQL-specific errors.

## Ensuring Type Safety with TypeScript Interfaces

To leverage TypeScript's benefits like autocompletion and compile-time error checking, we should define interfaces that match the expected structure of the data returned by our `GET_RECENT_NFTS` query.

```typescript
// Describes the detailed fields for a listed item
interface NFTItem {
  rindexerId: string;
  seller: string;
  nftAddress: string;
  price: string; // Note: Blockchain values are often strings (BigInts)
  tokenId: string;
  contractAddress: string;
  txHash: string;
  blockNumber: string; // Often a string, may need parsing to number/BigInt
}

// Describes the minimal data needed for bought/cancelled items (for filtering)
interface BoughtCancelled {
  nftAddress: string;
  tokenId: string;
}

// Describes the overall structure of the GraphQL response JSON
interface NFTQueryResponse {
  data: {
    allItemListeds: {
      nodes: NFTItem[];
    };
    allItemCanceleds: { // Ensure these names match your actual schema/query
      nodes: BoughtCancelled[];
    };
    allItemBoughts: { // Ensure these names match your actual schema/query
      nodes: BoughtCancelled[];
    };
  };
  // Optional: include 'errors' field if you want to type GraphQL errors
  errors?: Array<{ message: string; [key: string]: any }>;
}

// Now, update the fetch function signature
async function fetchNFTs(): Promise<NFTQueryResponse> {
  // ... (fetch implementation as above) ...
  const jsonResponse = await response.json();
  // ... (error handling as above) ...
  return jsonResponse as NFTQueryResponse; // Assert the type
}
```

By defining `NFTItem`, `BoughtCancelled`, and `NFTQueryResponse`, we clearly document the expected data shape and enable TypeScript to catch potential inconsistencies if the API response structure changes or if we misuse the data in our component. We update the `fetchNFTs` function signature to return a `Promise<NFTQueryResponse>`.

## Preparing for Advanced Data Handling

We now have a robust way to fetch the necessary data (`ItemListed`, `ItemBought`, `ItemCanceled` events) from our Rindexer GraphQL API into our Next.js application using standard `fetch` and TypeScript.

The next logical steps involve:

1.  **Client-Side Filtering:** Implementing the logic within the `RecentlyListed.tsx` component (or a related hook) to process the data returned by `fetchNFTs`. This involves iterating through `allItemListeds.nodes` and removing any item whose `nftAddress` and `tokenId` combination also exists in either `allItemCanceleds.nodes` or `allItemBoughts.nodes`.
2.  **State Management:** Integrating a data-fetching and state management library like `@tanstack/react-query`. This library simplifies handling loading states, error states, caching, background refetching, and synchronizing the fetched data with the React component's state, significantly reducing boilerplate code compared to managing `fetch` calls manually with `useState` and `useEffect`. Many projects using libraries like Wagmi might already have `@tanstack/react-query` installed as a dependency.

While AI tools like DeepSeek can assist in generating boilerplate code (especially if provided with the GraphQL schema SDL and component structure), remember to carefully review and adapt any AI-generated code to ensure it aligns perfectly with your project's requirements, chosen libraries (like `fetch` vs. `graphql-request`), and coding standards.
