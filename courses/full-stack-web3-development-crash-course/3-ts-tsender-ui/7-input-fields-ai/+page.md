## Building Reusable UI Components with AI Assistance in Next.js

This lesson guides you through building foundational UI components for a Next.js web application, specifically focusing on creating a reusable header and input fields. We'll leverage AI assistance for generating boilerplate code and integrate these components effectively within the Next.js App Router structure.

Our starting point is a basic Next.js page displaying minimal content. We aim to replicate the header and form structure seen on sites like `t-sender.com`.

## Creating a Reusable Header Component

**The Problem:** Our initial `page.tsx` might only contain specific page content and perhaps a connect button. However, most web applications require a consistent header across all pages, containing elements like the site title, navigation links (like a GitHub link), and user authentication status (like a wallet connect button). Repeating this header code on every single page is inefficient and hard to maintain.

**The Solution: React Components:** React allows us to break down our UI into reusable pieces called components. A component encapsulates its own HTML structure (using JSX/TSX), styling, and logic. By creating a dedicated `Header` component, we can define it once and use it wherever needed, ensuring consistency and making updates easier.

**Component Structure:** Standard practice dictates placing reusable components in a dedicated folder.

1.  Create a `components` folder within your `src` directory: `src/components`.
2.  Inside `src/components`, create a new file for our header: `Header.tsx`.

**Leveraging AI for Code Generation:** Generating standard UI elements like headers is often a task well-suited for AI code assistants (like DeepSeek or Claude). They can quickly produce boilerplate code based on your requirements.

**Prompting Strategy for the Header:**

To get useful code from an AI, provide clear context and requirements:

1.  **Provide Existing Code:** Copy the relevant parts of your current `page.tsx`, especially imports and usage related to elements you want in the header (like `ConnectButton`).
2.  **State the Goal:** Clearly ask the AI to create a reusable header component. Example: "Can you turn this into a reusable header component with:"
3.  **List Specific Elements:** Enumerate the required features:
    *   A title (e.g., 'tsender').
    *   A link/button to a GitHub repository.
    *   The existing `ConnectButton` positioned on the right side.
4.  **Specify Libraries/Imports:** Guide the AI by listing allowed imports. This helps constrain the output and ensures compatibility with your project's dependencies. For example:
    ```
    Can you only use the following imports?
    ```
    ```typescript
    import { ConnectButton } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";
    import { FaGithub } from "react-icons/fa";
    import Image from "next/image"; // (If using Next/Image for logos)
    ```
5.  **Install Dependencies:** If the AI uses libraries you don't have, install them. For the GitHub icon (`FaGithub`), you'll need `react-icons`:
    ```bash
    pnpm add react-icons
    ```

**Reviewing and Integrating AI Code:**

*   **Context Awareness:** Note that AI might infer the context (like JSX) but might not know specifics (like TypeScript/TSX) unless explicitly told. More context usually yields better results.
*   **Critical Review:** *Always* treat AI-generated code as if it came from a junior developer. Review it carefully to ensure it's correct, secure, and aligns with your project's standards. Understand every line before using it.
*   **Integration:**
    1.  Copy the generated TSX code block for the `Header` functional component.
    2.  Paste it into your `src/components/Header.tsx` file.
    3.  Adjust any placeholders, such as updating the GitHub link URL to your specific repository.
    4.  Observe the styling: The AI likely used utility classes (e.g., from Tailwind CSS if prompted or inferred) for layout (`flex`, `justify-between`, `items-center`) and appearance (`p-4`, `bg-white`, `shadow-md`).

**Using the Header Component:**

Initially, let's add the header to our main page to test it:

1.  Open `src/app/page.tsx`.
2.  Import the `Header` component:
    ```typescript
    import Header from "@/components/Header"; // Adjust path if necessary
    ```
    *(Note: `@/` implies configured path aliases in `tsconfig.json`)*
3.  Use the component within the `Home` function, replacing any standalone elements now handled by the header:
    ```typescript
    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <div>
          <Header />
          {/* Rest of the page content */}
          Hi
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
4.  Run your development server (`pnpm run dev`). You should see the header rendered above your page content.

**Making the Header Global with `layout.tsx`:**

The header shouldn't just be on the home page; it needs to be on *every* page. Next.js's App Router provides the `layout.tsx` file for this exact purpose.

1.  **Concept:** The `layout.tsx` file acts as a template wrapping around your page content (`props.children`). Any components placed *outside* of `{props.children}` within the layout's return statement will render on every page governed by that layout.
2.  **Action:**
    *   Open `src/app/layout.tsx`.
    *   Import the `Header` component:
        ```typescript
        import Header from "@/components/Header";
        ```
    *   Place the `<Header />` component inside the `<body>` tag, usually *before* the `{props.children}`:
        ```typescript
        <body>
          <Providers> {/* Assuming you have Providers wrapper */}
            <Header /> {/* Add the Header here */}
            {props.children}
          </Providers>
        </body>
        ```
    *   Go back to `src/app/page.tsx` and *remove* the `<Header />` component and its import. The page should only contain its specific content now.
        ```typescript
        export default function Home() {
          return (
            <div>
              Hi
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```
3.  **Result:** Refresh your browser. The header now appears persistently, managed by the layout, while `page.tsx` remains clean and focused on its unique content.

## Creating Reusable Input Fields for a Form

With the header in place, let's focus on building the main interaction area â€“ an airdrop form. This form will require several input fields (Token Address, Recipients, Amounts). To avoid repetition, we'll create a reusable `InputField` component.

**Planning the Form Structure:**

1.  Create a component specifically for the form: `src/components/AirdropForm.tsx`.
2.  Recognize the need for multiple similar input fields (some single-line, some multi-line). This justifies creating a generic, reusable input component.
3.  Create a conventional `ui` subfolder for general-purpose UI elements: `src/components/ui/`.
4.  Create the input field component file: `src/components/ui/InputField.tsx`.

**Using AI for the Input Field Component:**

Generating form elements is another good use case for AI.

**Prompting Strategy for the Input Field:**

1.  **State the Goal & Tech:** "I'm looking to make an input field react component with tsx."
2.  **Specify Props:** Define the necessary properties (props) the component should accept and their types/purpose:
    *   `label` (string): Text label displayed above the input.
    *   `placeholder` (string): Placeholder text inside the input.
    *   `value` (string): The current value of the input (controlled component).
    *   `type` (string): The HTML input type (e.g., "text", "number").
    *   `large` (boolean): A flag to indicate whether to render a multi-line `<textarea>` instead of a single-line `<input>`.
    *   `onChange` (function): A callback function to execute when the input's value changes.
3.  **Specify Styling:** "I'm using tailwind for styling."

**Reviewing and Integrating the Input Field:**

1.  **AI Output:** The AI should generate an `InputField` component, likely including:
    *   A `Props` interface (e.g., `InputFieldProps`) defining the expected properties and their types (using `ChangeEventHandler` from React for `onChange`).
    *   Conditional rendering logic: `if (large) { return <textarea ... />; } else { return <input ... />; }`.
    *   Tailwind CSS classes for styling the label, input/textarea.
    *   Correct wiring of props (`label`, `placeholder`, `value`, `type`, `onChange`) to the underlying HTML elements.
2.  **Integration:** Copy the generated TSX code into `src/components/ui/InputField.tsx`. You might slightly adjust type definitions (like the `onChange` event type to explicitly handle both `HTMLInputElement` and `HTMLTextAreaElement`) based on preference or stricter typing needs, but the AI's version is often functional.
    ```typescript
    // Example type for onChange prop in InputFieldProps
    onChange: (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>) => void;
    ```

**Using the `InputField` in `AirdropForm`:**

Now, let's use our new `InputField` component within the `AirdropForm`.

1.  Open `src/components/AirdropForm.tsx`.
2.  **Add Client Directive:** Since this component will manage state (`useState`) and handle user events (`onChange`), mark it as a Client Component by adding `"use client";` at the very top of the file.
3.  **Import Dependencies:**
    ```typescript
    import { useState } from "react";
    import InputField from "@/components/ui/InputField"; // Adjust path if needed
    ```
4.  **Manage State:** Use the `useState` hook to manage the data for each input field. Start with the token address:
    ```typescript
    export default function AirdropForm() {
      const [tokenAddress, setTokenAddress] = useState<string>("");
      // State for other fields (recipients, amounts) will be added later

      // ... rest of the component
    }
    ```
5.  **Render the Input Field:** Use the `InputField` component in the return statement, passing the required props:
    ```typescript
    export default function AirdropForm() {
      const [tokenAddress, setTokenAddress] = useState<string>("");

      return (
        <div className="p-4 space-y-4"> {/* Add some padding/spacing */}
          <InputField
            label="Token Address"
            placeholder="Enter token contract address (e.g., 0x...)"
            value={tokenAddress}
            onChange={(e) => setTokenAddress(e.target.value)} // Update state on change
            type="text" // Explicitly set type
            // 'large' prop is omitted (defaults to false or not needed for single line)
          />

          {/* We will add InputFields for Recipients and Amounts here later */}

          {/* Button to trigger the airdrop will be added later */}
        </div>
      );
    }

    ```
6.  **Integrate `AirdropForm` into the Page:** Finally, use the `AirdropForm` component in your main page (`src/app/page.tsx` or another relevant page).
    ```typescript
    // In src/app/page.tsx
    import AirdropForm from "@/components/AirdropForm";

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <main className="p-4"> {/* Add some padding for content area */}
          {/* The Header is already handled by layout.tsx */}
          <AirdropForm />
        </main>
      );
    }
    ```

**Result:** When you run your application, you should now see the global header and the beginning of your airdrop form, featuring the "Token Address" input field rendered by your reusable `InputField` component. The input field will update its state within the `AirdropForm` as you type.

This lesson demonstrated how to create modular, reusable UI components in React/Next.js, utilize `layout.tsx` for global elements, and effectively employ AI assistance for generating boilerplate code, significantly speeding up the UI development process. Remember to always review and understand AI-generated code before integrating it.
