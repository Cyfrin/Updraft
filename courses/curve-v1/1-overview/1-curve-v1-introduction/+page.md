This course is an introduction to the Curve V1 AMM.

We'll start by looking at the prerequisites for this course. You should be an intermediate Solidity developer, and have experience with Foundry. You should also understand the mathematics of constant product AMMs and constant sum AMMs.

Here are some optional prerequisites for this course:

*   Uniswap V2 and V3
*   A basic understanding of DeFi.
*   Python

In the course, we'll compare Uniswap V2, V3, and Curve V1. We'll also discuss some basic DeFi concepts, such as stablecoins like DAI and USDC.

A basic understanding of DeFi will help.

Finally, we have some optional lessons where we'll use Python to show you some of the math of Curve V1.

These are nice to have, but they're not required to follow along with the course.

Here are a few reasons why you should take this course:

*   Understanding Curve V1 might give you some ideas for new AMM design.
*   It might also help you in audit contests and bug bounties.
*   It is a prerequisite to understand Curve V2.

Here's what we'll learn in this course:

*   The math and algorithms of Curve V1
*   Vyper
*   Testing with Foundry

Curve V1 is written in Vyper, and we'll do a code walkthrough of the Curve V1 contract. You'll gain some experience reading Vyper. There are exercises and solutions written in Foundry, so you'll have hands-on experience testing with Foundry.
