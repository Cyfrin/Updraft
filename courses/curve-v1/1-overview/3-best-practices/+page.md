We will be using a GitHub repository called `advanced-defi-2024`. For the course for Curve V1, we need to scroll down and look for a Markdown file called `curve-v1.md`.

Click on this file to go to the Markdown file that shows all the links that we will need in this course. This file lists the prerequisites that we have already discussed and the tools that we will need. 

The tools that we will need are:
* Foundry
* Python/Jupyter Lab (optional)

For each lesson, we need to watch the videos on Cyfrin Updraft. For the exercises, we can find the link under the section called Topics.  Scrolling down, we see a section called Topics and then links to exercises and solutions under the sections for each lesson.

There are other links inside this Markdown file, some of them linked to code used in the videos, others linked to notes and graphs. 

If we have further questions, we can navigate to GitHub discussions under this repository.
