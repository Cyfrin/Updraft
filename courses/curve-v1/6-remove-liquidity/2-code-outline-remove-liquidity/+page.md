## Removing Liquidity from a Pool

We're going to look at the function `remove_liquidity`, which allows users to withdraw their tokens from a pool. There are four main steps involved in this process:

1. **Calculating Token Amounts**: The first step is to determine the amount of tokens the user will be withdrawing. The amount will depend on the user's provided LP shares.
2. **Updating Token Balances (Storage)**: Next, the state variables that track the token balances for the pool are updated to reflect the removal of liquidity.
3. **Transfer Tokens Out**: The calculated token amounts are then transferred to the user's address.
4. **Burn LP Shares**: Finally, the LP shares associated with the removed liquidity are burned.

The function `remove_liquidity` allows users to recover their invested capital from a pool. This process is crucial for maintaining a dynamic and liquid market by enabling users to manage their positions.
