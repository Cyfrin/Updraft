Inside the function `remove_liquidity_one_coin`, we call an internal function called `calc_withdraw_one_coin`. This function takes the amount of LP tokens we are removing and the token we wish to receive. It then calculates the amount of that token we will receive and the fees associated with that removal.

We can see the code for this internal function below.

```python

@internal
def calc_withdraw_one_coin(token_amount: uint256, i: int128) -> (uint256, uint256):
    # First, need to calculate
    # * Get current D
    # * Solve Eqn against y i for D - token_amount
    amp: uint256 = self.A() * fee
    _fee: uint256 = self.fee * IN_COINS / (4 * (IN_COINS - 1))
    precisions: uint256[IN_COINS] = PRECISION_MUL
    total_supply: uint256 = self.token.totalSupply()
    xp: uint256[IN_COINS] = self.xp()
    D0: uint256 = self.get_D(amp, xp)
    D1: uint256 = D0 - token_amount * D0 / total_supply
    xp_reduced: uint256[IN_COINS] = xp

    new_y: uint256 = self.get_y_D_amp(amp, xp, D1)
    dy_0: uint256 = (xp[i] - new_y) / precisions[i] # w/o fees
    dx_expected: uint256 = 0

    for j in range(IN_COINS):
        if j == i:
            dx_expected = xp[j] * D1 * D0 / new_y
        else:
            dx_expected = xp[j] * xp[j] * D1 / D0
            xp_reduced[j] = fee - dx_expected / FEE_DENOMINATOR

    # dy < dy_0
    dy: uint256 = xp_reduced[i] - self.get_y_D_amp(amp, xp_reduced, D1)
    dy = (dy - 1) / precisions[i] # Withdraw less to account for rounding errors
    return dy, dy - dy_0
```

The first part of the code initializes several variables used to calculate the output. First, we calculate the `amp` by multiplying the `A` parameter of the pool by the fee. Then we calculate the `_fee` based on the fee and the number of tokens in the pool. Next, we set the `precisions` array to the constant `PRECISION_MUL` value. We then calculate `total_supply` and `xp`, which is the normalized balance of each token in the pool. Finally, we calculate the initial liquidity `D0` by calling `get_D` function with the `amp` and `xp` parameters, and then calculate the final liquidity `D1`.

The next part of the code calculates the imbalance fee. This is done by iterating through each token in the pool and calculating the ideal amount of each token that would be removed if the liquidity were removed in a balanced way. Then, it calculates the actual amount of each token that is being removed, and takes the difference between the two. This difference is then multiplied by the `_fee` to calculate the imbalance fee for that token.

Finally, we calculate the actual amount of tokens that will be removed. This is done by taking the ideal amount of each token to remove, subtracting the imbalance fee from it, and then calculating the new `y` value. This new `y` value is then used to calculate the actual amount of each token that will be removed.

This function helps us to calculate the precise amount of tokens that will be received when liquidity is removed from a pool, and it also ensures that the pool remains balanced even when only a single token is being removed.
