### Wrap Up

There's a large assumption here that ... you're not a noob. I'm going to approach these lessons as though you're already experience in this space, so be prepared and come ready.

There's no harm in going back into the prerequisite courses to shake off the rust, or brush up on concepts.

With that said, when you're ready.. let's get started!

See you in the next lesson!
