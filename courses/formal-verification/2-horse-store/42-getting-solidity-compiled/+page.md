### Breaking Down Solidity

In this lesson we're going to breakdown Solidity into it's component bytecode and directly compare the op codes in Solidity with those of Huff.

Start by creating a new folder named `breakdowns`, we'll be compiling our op code breakdowns in here.

Navigate to `out/horseStoreV1/HorseStore.sol/HorseStore.json`. This is the ABI of our deployed HorseStore contract. Within this file you'll find a `bytecode` object with an `object` property. This represents our op codes for the contract in bytecode!

::image{src='/formal-verification-1/42-solidity-opcodes-from-bytecode/solidity-opcodes-from-bytecode1.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

Create a new file named `solc-breakdowns.c++`. This won't actually be a C++ file, but some of the syntax highlighting for C++ will make things easier on us. You can paste your bytecode to the top of this file as a comment for reference.

As we know, every 2 digits in this bytecode represents an op code. For example, the very first pair `60` is `PUSH1`. We could absolutely go through the bytecode, pair by pair and break things down that way.

But that's a lot of work.

Let's take our bytecode and paste it into the **[evm.codes playground](https://www.evm.codes/playground)**. By switching the left panel to `mneumonic` via the drop down we'll be given a list of the op codes for this contract! It should look something like this:

Paste this into our `solc-breakdowns.c++` files and we'll get started walking through this contract's execution in the next lesson.
