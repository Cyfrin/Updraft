### Installing the Huff Extension in VS Code

If you'd like to take advantage of the syntax highlighting you see me using for Huff, you'll need to get your hands on the Huff extension.

```markdown
- Open VS Code.
- Navigate to the extensions tab (it looks like a square on the left sidebar).
- Search for **Huff**.
- Click **Install**.
```

::image{src='/formal-verification-1/6-huff-syntax-highlighting/huff-syntax-highlighting-1.png' style='width: 75%; height: auto;'}

This should add a much needed level of clarity while developing in Huff, and as Patrick says: "It'll give you these nice little highlightings."

### Why Syntax Highlighting Matters

You might wonder why you should bother with syntax highlighting. Let's spell it out:

1. **Readability**: With syntax highlighting, each part of your code stands out. Functions, variables, and other elements are distinguishable at a glance.
2. **Debugging**: It's easier to spot mistakes when incorrect syntax sticks out like a sore thumb.
3. **Faster Coding**: Recognizing patterns by color helps you code quicker. You're not parsing text; you're visually zipping through the logic.

Syntax highlighting doesn't just serve aesthetic purposesâ€”it's a tool that can genuinely make your coding experience less stressful.
