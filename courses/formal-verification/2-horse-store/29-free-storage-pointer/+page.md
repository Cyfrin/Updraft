### Assigning Storage Slots

Our numberOfHorses variable requires a storage slot, and there's a number of ways we could approach this. We could absolutely hardcode a storage slot for example.

Fortunately, Huff makes working with storage slots a little bit easier through a convenient abstraction: `FREE_STORAGE_POINTER()`. `FREE_STORAGE_POINTER()` effectively works as a counter for available storage slots. Let's add this to our code base.

```js
/*Interface*/
#define function updateHorseNumber(uint256) nonpayable returns()
#define function readNumberOfHorses() view returns(uint256)

#define constant NUMBER_OF_HORSES_STORAGE_SLOT = FREE_STORAGE_POINTER()

#define macro MAIN() = takes(0) returns(0){
    0x00 calldataload 0xe0 shr                                  // [function_selector]

    // updateHorseNumber, 0xcdfead2e
    dup1 __FUNC_SIG(updateHorseNumber) eq updateJump jumpi      // [function_selector]

    // readNumberOfHorses, 0xe026c017
    __FUNC_SIG(readNumberOfHorses) eq readJump jumpi            // []

    0x00 0x00 revert

    updateJump:
        SET_NUMBER_OF_HORSES()
    readJump:
        GET_NUMBER_OF_HORSES()
}

#define macro SET_NUMBER_OF_HORSES() = takes(0) returns(0){}
#define macro GET_NUMBER_OF_HORSES() = takes(0) returns(0){}
```

What the line `#define constant NUMBER_OF_HORSES_STORAGE_SLOT = FREE_STORAGE_POINTER()` is doing is defining a particular storage slot to be used for this constant variable. `FREE_STORAGE_POINTER()` will return the next sequentially available storage slot, assigning our constant, in this case, to 0. The next time `FREE_STORAGE_POINTER()` is called it will assign 1.

This is exactly how Solidity handles things as well!

With our above implementation, any time somebody looks at storage slot 0, that's where numberOfHorses will be found. Great work!
