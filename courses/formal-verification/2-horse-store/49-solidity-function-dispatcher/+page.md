### Solidity's Function Dispatcher

The next chunk of op codes we come across is going to represent Solidity's `function dispatcher`. Let's go through how it works together. As always, here's a reference of the op codes we've covered so far and where we are in the execution:

```js
PUSH0 0x00        // [0x00]
CALLDATALOAD      // [CALLDATA_32BYTES]
PUSH1 0xe0        // [0xe0, CALLDATA_32BYTES]
SHR               // [calldata[0:4]] // function selector
DUP1              // [func_selector, func_selector]
PUSH4 0xcdfead2e  // [0xcdfead2e, func_selector, func_selector]
EQ                // [0xcdfead2e == func_selector, func_selector]
PUSH1 0x34        // [0x34, 0xcdfead2e == func_selector, func_selector]
JUMPI             // [func_selector]
```

So what's this doing?  We're pushing `0x00` to the stack and executing `CALLDATALOAD`, we've seen this one before. It takes a bytes offset from the top of our stack (`0x00`) and adds to our stack 32 Bytes of call data beginning at the offset.

We next execute a right shift with `SHR`. If we recall, it takes an amount to shift and the data to be shifted. `cast to-base 0xe0 dec` will tell us we're shifting our `CALLDATA_32BYTES` 224 bits (28 Bytes) to the right. This is going to leave the first 4 bytes of our `call data`, on the stack - our `function selector`.

What remains will look something like this:
```
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000xcdfead2e
```

In Solidity the function dispatching is all done under the hood, we didn't have to code any of this, like we did with Huff.  We're going to get to compare how our function dispatcher performs versus Solidity's!

In fact our experience coding this function dispatcher in Huff should make this next chunk fairly familiar to us:

### Update Number of Horses

```js
PUSH4 0xcdfead2e  // [0xcdfead2e, func_selector, func_selector]
EQ                // [0xcdfead2e == func_selector, func_selector]
PUSH1 0x34        // [0x34, 0xcdfead2e == func_selector, func_selector]
JUMPI             // [func_selector]
// if func_selector == 0xcdfead2e jump to set_number_of_horses
```
We're pushing  our known function selector to the stack (this is our `updateNumberOfHorses()` function!), and then comparing it to the `call data` `function selector` to see if there's a match.

We then push a program counter/`JUMPDEST` to the stack and execute `JUMPI`, jumping to that function's logic if `0xcdfead2e == func_selector`.

We won't jump yet, let's keep going to see how the next function is routed.

### Read Number of Horses

```js
JUMPI             // [func_selector]
// if func_selector == 0xcdfead2e jump to set_number_of_horses

DUP1              // [func_selector, func_selector]
PUSH4 0xe026c017  // [0xe026c017, func_selector, func_selector]
EQ                // [0xe026c017 == func_selector, func_selector]
PUSH1 0x45        // [0x45, 0xe026c017 == func_selector, func_selector]
JUMPI             // [func_selector]
```

Basically the same process is being followed for the second function of our Solidity contract.

- Duplicate the `function selector` from `call data`
- Push our known `function selector` (0xe026c017 `readNumberOfHorses()`)
- Use `EQ` to determine if they are equal
- Push a program counter/`JUMPDEST` to the stack
- `JUMPI` to the `JUMPDEST` if the `call data` function selector and the known `function selector` are equal.

Something to note here - In the `function dispatcher` we wrote in Huff, we recognized that our second check wouldn't require duplicating the `func_selector` again. Solidity however *does* still perform this duplication! This is a potential gas optimization we've found already!

If a `function selector` isn't found during this dispatch, we can see we've returned to this revert block we used earlier:
```js
JUMPDEST 
PUSH0 
DUP1 
REVERT 
```

This will prevent calls to our contract from executing arbitrary code if a `function selector` match isn't found.

We're already through over half the op codes of our contract and you're doing phenomenally. Let's keep going!
