### Non-Payable Constructor Check

When going through op codes, I like to repeatedly ask myself _What does this chunk do?_. Let's look at the next check and walk through is execution.

I'll typically look out for 'break points', things like `Revert` and `Return` to determine where a "chunk" starts and stops.

```
CALLVALUE    // [msg.value]
DUP1         // [msg.value, msg.value]
ISZERO       // [msg.value == 0, msg.value]
PUSH1 0x0e   // [0x0e, msg.value == 0, msg.value]
JUMPI        // [msg.value]
PUSH0        // [0, msg.value]
DUP1         // [0, 0, msg.value]
REVERT       // [msg.value]
```

I've added our comment notation to our op code list to keep track of what's on our stack. So, what's happening here?

We've seen many of these op codes before, but some of them are new. Each time a new op code is mentioned, I'll include a screenshot of it's details from [evm.codes](https://www.evm.codes/#34?fork=cancun). I encourage you to use this website like a dictionary as we attempt to define what's being executed. `CALLVALUE` adds to the stack, the value included with the current call.

::image{src='/formal-verification-1/44-msg.value-check/msg_value-check1.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

We then duplicate this value with `DUP1` and check if it's equal to zero with the conditional `ISZERO`

::image{src='/formal-verification-1/44-msg.value-check/msg_value-check2.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

Next it looks like we're setting up the executions response to this `ISZERO` conditional. We push a program counter/jump destination to the stack with PUSH1 0x0e then execute JUMPI.

If the result of ISZERO is true (the msg.value is zero), the execution will jump to 0x0e to continue.

If the result of ISZERO is false (the msg.value is greater than zero), the execution won't jump. We see the next operations queues if we don't jump:

```
PUSH0
PUSH0
REVERT
```

It's going to revert! You can even see this in our foundry script if you try to pass a value to our contract creation, in our test. It won't even let us compile!

### Summary

To summarize, what this chunk is doing is:

1. Checks if a value is being sent with our constructor/contract creation
2. reverts if value is being sent
3. jumps over revert to continue logic if no value is sent.

Things really become easier if you break them down one step at a time. Let's see what happens if we don't revert in the next lesson.
