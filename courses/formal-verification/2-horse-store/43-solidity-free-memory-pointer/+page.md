### Starting the Op Code Breakdown

Let's start breaking down what all the op codes in our `solc-breakdowns.c++` file do.

I'll update this reference as we go through each section of bytecode:

Let's remind ourselves of the 3 sections found in a smart contract's bytecode and start from the top!

1. Contract Creation
2. Runtime
3. Metadata

### Contract Creation Code

```
0x6080604052

Op Codes:
PUSH1 0x80
PUSH1 0x40
MSTORE
```

This section of bytecode is going to be seen in almost every contract you work with and represents the first part of the `Contract Creation Code`. Any time we send a transaction on chain, the entry point of our transaction will be the first couple op codes.

```
PUSH1 0x80
PUSH1 0x40
MSTORE
```

These op codes represent Solidity's `Free Memory Pointer`. Their execution, in order will:

1. Push 0x80 to the stack
2. Push 0x40 to the stack
3. Stores the value of 0x80, offset by 0x40 into memory

Previously I'd described memory as an array with slots demarked with indexes. This isn't entirely accurate. Memory is more accurately a string of bytes with sections denoted by 32 byte offsets which represent areas in which we would store 32 byte sized pieces of data.

A part of memory management is keeping track of where in this memory "array" we have free memory available (to avoid overwriting previously stored data!). This is where the `free memory pointer` comes in.

What these op codes are doing, is making a note of where our free memory is located, at 0x40. The idea being that every time we want to write to memory, we'll do 3 things:

1. Check the value stored at 0x40 to determine where free memory is available
2. write our data to the free memory location
3. update the `free memory pointer` (0x40) with the new location of free memory

In Solidity `0x40` is special and exists as this `free memory pointer`. Not all languages share this feature however, Vyper and Huff being notable examples of not having a `free memory pointer`

As we walk through the solidity op codes, we'll see the free memory pointer being referenced and updated many times. We'll become very familiar with it's use!
