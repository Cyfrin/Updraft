I'll keep a running reminder of our current total contract state at the top of each lesson moving forward as a point of reference.

### feedHorse Macro

We're going to begin with the feedHorse Macro. It shouldn't be too tough. Let's start by looking at the Solidity.

```js
function feedHorse(uint256 horseId) external {
    horseIdToFedTimeStamp[horseId] = block.timestamp;
}
```

This is going to one of the most important functions we learn about in this section as we'll be touching on `timestamps` _and_ `mappings`!

We're going to need to access the block's timestamp, fortunately there's an op code that does just this `TIMESTAMP`.

::image{src='/formal-verification-1/64-feedhorse-macro/feedhorse_macro1.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

So, our function takes a `uint256 horseId`, we're going to want to add this to our stack as well. We know how to do this with the op code `calldataload`, which takes an offset, then adds 32 bytes of call data from the offset to our stack.

```js
#define macro FEED_HORSE() = takes(0) returns (0) {
    timestamp          // [timestamp]
    0x04 calldataload  //[horseId, timestamp]
}
```

Things look great, what's our next step? Think of what a mapping is. We're going to need to `sstore` our `timestamp` to our `horseId` key.

We'll look at how that's done in the next lesson!
