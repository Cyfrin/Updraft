### Debugging with Hexadecimal Values

When encountering an issue in MathMasters, it's crucial to identify where the error is originating. Typically, we start by examining the most likely sections of code, which, in this case, is the top half. Here’s how you can pinpoint the error using a hexadecimal (hex) approach.

#### The Cheat Sheet: Casting to Hex

1. **Casting Decimals to Hexadecimal**:
   - Take the decimal value and convert it to hex.
   - For example, if the decimal casts to hex as "FFFF...", this indicates a full set of F’s in hexadecimal.

2. **Replacing Values**:
   - If the hex result is a series of F's (e.g., "FFFF"), replace the existing value with "FFFF...".
   - Perform this check consistently across multiple variables or segments to ensure uniformity.

#### Example Debugging Steps:

- **First Decimal**: Convert to hex, result is "FFFF...". Replace original value with "FFFF...".
- **Second Decimal**: Repeat the process. Convert, check, and replace with "FFFF..." if necessary.
- **Third Decimal**: Follow the same steps, ensuring the value aligns with expected hex output.
- **Fourth Decimal**: This conversion shows "FFF2A", different from the others. This discrepancy suggests a potential error.

#### Implementing the Fix:

1. **Update the Code**:
   - Replace the erroneous "FFF2A" with the correct "FFFF..." or appropriate value.
   - Update this in the MathMasters code base to ensure consistency and correctness.

2. **Verification**:
   - With the changes made, conduct a modular verification to see if the adjustments align with the expected outcomes from a similar, trusted module, such as Soulmate.
   - Use tools like Certora for running checks. Successful verification shows no errors, confirming that the issue likely resides in the modified segment.

#### Final Checks and Validation:

- **Review Configuration Files**: Ensure there are no additional settings or rules that might interfere with the fixed implementations.
- **Rule Sanity Check**: Quick validation that no other configuration disrupts the intended behavior.
