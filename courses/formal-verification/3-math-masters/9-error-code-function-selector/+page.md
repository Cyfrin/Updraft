### Hex Code Verification and Error Handling

In our exploration of hex codes, it's crucial to verify each component meticulously, as we're doing now. Let's take a closer look at the function selector which is integral to error handling. Surprisingly, even errors are equipped with function selectors, which guide us in identifying and categorizing them accurately.

#### Incorrect Function Selector Detected

While examining our current setup, I realized that the function selector in use was incorrect. By implementing a tool like `cast sig`, I can easily paste and check the intended selector. Alarmingly, the one we're using doesn't match the required function selector. Hereâ€™s what went wrong:

- **Initial Discovery:** The function selector I encountered was not the one expected.
- **Correct Function Signature:** After further checking, I identified the correct function signature, which differs from the value currently being used.
- **Error Analysis:** It appears there is a misunderstanding or misapplication in the selection of the function selector. The error could range from low to informational, depending on its impact on the overall system.


Seem a lot is wrong with a small section of the code even though it looks actually correct, so let's see how to address this on the next lessons.
