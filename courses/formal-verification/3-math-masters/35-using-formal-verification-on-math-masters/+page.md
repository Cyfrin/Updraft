title: Using Formal Verification On Math Masters
---

---


### Game Plan Overview

In our upcoming lessons, we're going to tackle the following key areas:

1. **Practicing Formal Verification**:
   - We will start by using Molwat for formal verification.
   - Initially, we will apply it using Halmos, followed by demonstrations in Sirtora.

2. **Application to the Square Root Function**:
   - We'll then use our newly acquired skills to explore the square root function.
   - This will lead us into discovering a significant problem.
   - We will employ clever methods to solve this issue using both Halmos and Shatura.

3. **Identifying and Understanding Issues**:
   - I will reveal a clue that should hint at the underlying issue with the square root function.
   - Despite often passing tests, we'll discuss why these results aren't entirely correct.
   - We'll identify edge cases and delve into more complex problem-solving.

4. **Concluding Insights**:
   - Finally, we will discuss what should have tipped us off about inaccuracies in the square root functionâ€™s behavior.

Through these steps, we'll deepen our understanding of formal verification and enhance our problem-solving skills.
