# Welcome to the Course

Hey there! Welcome back to the EVM opcodes, formal verification, and symbolic execution course. Now with Math masters section.

**Starting Point**

Everything kicks off in our [GitHub](https://github.com/Cyfrin/assembly-evm-opcodes-and-formal-verification-course?tab=readme-ov-file#section-2-introduction-to-formal-verification--symbolic-execution--math-master) repository. Whether you're here via Cyfrin or YouTube, that's where you'll find what you need. It’s straightforward—discussion forums, course materials, and a way to connect with others in the course.

## Into Formal Verification and Symbolic Execution

### Math Master Audit

We're diving into formal verification and symbolic execution with a practical challenge: the Math Master audit. It's tough, no sugar-coating it. Certora and Halmos, the tools we'll tackle, are not simple, but getting through this means gaining some serious skills in smart contract security.


### Hands-On with Auditing

You'll get hands-on experience auditing the Math Master library, a smart contract focused on arithmetic for fixed-point numbers. 

 You'll scrutinize a concise codebase, heavily reliant on assembly and low-level `Yul`, containing functions designed for operations with fixed-point numbers. Among these, the `mulwad` and `mulWadUp` functions stand out, alongside a particularly complex square root function—a dense assembly code chunk ripe for bug hunting.

 Basically Math masters is a library to make math calculations easier.

### Learning Formal Verification Tools

We'll introduce you to formal verification tools like Halmos and Certora, essential for finding bugs that other methods might miss. 

### Advancing Your Skills

As the course progresses, your skills in formal verification will deepen. This isn’t just about learning; it’s about becoming part of a select group with advanced knowledge in smart contract security and auditing.

So we you hope you are ready, because we are just getting stated!
