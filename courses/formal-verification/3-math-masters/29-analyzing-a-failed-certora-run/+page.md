title: Analyzing a failed Certora Run

### Running make Certora and Monitoring the Process

When you initiate the execution of make Certora, it requires some patience as the output generation and processing might take a little time. The UI displays the progress, and you can track the status through various indicators.

####Understanding the Output

Once the process concludes, you'll notice specific indicators like:
- A checkmark next to envfree funk status check," signifying that no environmental variables (`env`) were used in the function, aligning with the constraints set by using the keyword `envfree`.
- A failure or violation mark next to hellFunc must never revert," indicating an issue where the conditions set by the function did not hold up as expected.

### Delving Deeper with Formal Verification

Using the toolâ€™s formal verification capabilities, you can explore why specific checks failed. For instance, with the hellFunc must never revert" check failing, formal verification reveals that the input `99` serves as a counterexample to the expected function behavior.

### Navigating the UI for More Insights

By interacting with the UI, you can:
- Select different rules and explore associated variables or call resolutions.
- Dive into the call trace to see the sequence of operations and state changes leading up to the failure.

### Analyzing the Call Trace

The call trace provides a detailed breakdown of the execution steps:
1. **Initial Setup**: Variables like `Numbir` might be set to unpredictable values, a process known as "havocing." This is crucial when external factors could alter state variables unpredictably.
2. **Execution Flow**: After setting up, the function attempts to execute and validate assertions. If `Numbir` is havoced to `0` instead of its typical `10`, it might trigger unexpected behaviors or reverts in the code.

### Relevance of Havocing

Havocing is a crucial concept in Certora where variables may assume any value due to external influences, thus impacting the function's behavior. In this scenario, even though `Numbir` was set to `10`, the assumption that it could be altered led to a reevaluation to `0`.
