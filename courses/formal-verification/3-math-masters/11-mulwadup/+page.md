**Course Correction Notice**

During the preparation of this course, I included an additional operation code (opcode) in the example we're discussing. Initially, I intended to introduce another bug to illustrate a point, but eventually, I found it overly cumbersome and not particularly educational. Consequently, I've decided to remove this complexity from the current video.

**Important:**
- If you notice the operation code `OR` mentioned or visible at any point in this video, please disregard it. This is a remnant from an earlier version of the course that I have since revised for clarity and simplicity. The `OR` opcode is not relevant to our current discussion and should be ignored.
