## Moccasin DeFi | Algorithmic Trading

We've just completed our section on Moccasin DeFi | Algorithmic Trading.  

Let's recap what we've learned:

* **DeFi** is a term used to describe decentralized finance happening within the blockchain space.
* We learned about two DeFi protocols:
    * **Aave**, similar to a classic bank, allows us to deposit money and gain interest. Aave also allows us to borrow money.
    * **Uniswap** is a decentralized exchange, allowing us to trade different assets.
* We practiced using these DeFi protocols in our Python notebook by:
    * Setting up and minting fake tokens.
    * Setting ourselves a fake balance.
    * Using a chainlink price feed to get the current price of our tokens.
    *  Calculating our portfolio allocation.
    *  Rebalancing our portfolio using Uniswap. 
    *  Depositing our tokens into Aave. 

We are now ready to move on to the next section, Moccasin DeFi | Stablecoin.  Take a break, go for a walk, or grab some ice cream. We will see you soon!
