## Introduction to Testing 

Now we are going to talk about testing our contracts, and how we can write very robust tests that will help us to be confident in our code. Our first workshop is very simple. If we run:

```bash
mox test --coverage
```

You should see a list of files with their coverage. We are primarily interested in the `dsc_engine.vy` file which has a coverage of 9%. Your first workshop is very simple, try to get the coverage above 80%.

You should not skip this workshop. We really want you to drill in on writing these tests, and understanding them. This is a great time to work with AI, and use AI to write these tests. We are not even talking about fuzz tests yet, just unit tests.

If you do get lost, we have a ton of tests in the GitHub repo associated with this section. Feel free to refer to them, pick and choose any number of the tests in here, or multiple of the tests in here. However, do not copy and paste these tests, try to write them yourself. We want you to take at least 30 minutes to an hour to write some tests yourself, so that you really understand what is going on. 

Pause the course, write some tests, and come back here, or ask questions, or compare. 

And if you do not understand why some tests are in here, great! Go to the discussions in the course and ask a question, ask your AI, etc.

Let's continue.
