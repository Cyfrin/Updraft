## Minting DSC

In the previous lesson, we added code to our fuzzer to mint and redeem collateral, but that code wasn't actually minting any DSC. To make the code more effective, we need to add a way to actually mint DSC. 

Let's start by adding a new rule to our fuzzer to generate a random user and mint some DSC. We'll use the `st.integers` strategy to generate a random user seed between 0 and `USERS_SIZE - 1`, and we'll also define a rule for a random amount of DSC to mint, using `st.integers` with a min value of 0 and a max value of `MAX_DEPOSIT_SIZE`.

```python
@rule
user_seed=st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=USERS_SIZE - 1)
```

```python
@rule
amount=st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=MAX_DEPOSIT_SIZE)
```

Next, we'll define a new function called `mint_dsc`, which will take the user seed, the amount of DSC to mint, and the collateral seed as parameters. 

```python
def mint_dsc(self, user_seed, amount, collateral_seed):
```

We'll use the `boa.env.prank` context manager to impersonate the user, and then call the `mint_dsc` function on the DSC engine.

```python
    user = self.users[user_seed]
    with boa.env.prank(user):
        self.dsce.mint_dsc(amount)
```

Now, let's run our fuzzer and see what happens.

```bash
python3 -k stablecoin_fuzzer
```

We get the following error message:

```
DSCEngine: Health factor broken
```

This error is happening because our fuzzer is trying to mint DSC without first providing the user with enough collateral.

To fix this issue, we need to add a try/except block around the `mint_dsc` function. If we encounter a `BoaError`, we'll check if the error message contains the phrase "Health factor broken". If it does, we'll call the internal `get_token_amount_from_usd` function on the DSC engine to calculate the amount of collateral needed, and then deposit the collateral into the user's account.

```python
def mint_dsc(self, user_seed, amount, collateral_seed):
    user = self.users[user_seed]
    with boa.env.prank(user):
        try:
            self.dsce.mint_dsc(amount)
        except BoaError as e:
            if "DSCEngine: Health factor broken" in str(e.stack_trace.vm_error):
                collateral = self._get_collateral_from_seed(collateral_seed)
                amount = self.dsce.get_token_amount_from_usd(collateral.address, amount)
                self.dsce.deposit_collateral(collateral.address, amount)
                if amount == 0:
                    self.mint_and_deposit(collateral_seed, user_seed, amount)
```

The `get_token_amount_from_usd` function is an external view on the DSC engine that takes the token address, the user's address, and the USD amount to deposit, and returns the amount of the token required to represent the given USD amount.

Now, let's run our fuzzer again. This time, we should see that the fuzzer passes without encountering the health factor broken error.

```bash
python3 -k stablecoin_fuzzer
```

As we can see, the fuzzer passes. This is because we have implemented a mechanism to handle the health factor broken error, and it's now possible to successfully mint DSC through our fuzzer.
