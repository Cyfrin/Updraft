## What happens when we stop our Anvil and Era Test Node?

When we stop our Era test node or Anvil node, our NFTs might still show up in our network, and they may go away. 

If we start getting some weird errors, we can click on the account in the top right corner of MetaMask, click on Settings, Advanced, and then click on Clear activity tab data. This will do a kind of reset. 

Obviously, right now, if we tried to send money because our Era test node is down, it would just gray out, which is really annoying. So, just know that we could even do a little refresh list, and it's going to just nothing's going to happen. So, just know that if our networks are down, if we're locally running networks are down, we might get some weird stuff showing up in our MetaMask. So, just be sure to keep that in mind.
