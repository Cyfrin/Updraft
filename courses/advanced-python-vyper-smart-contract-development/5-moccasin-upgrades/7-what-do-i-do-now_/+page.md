## What Do I Do Now?

We've finished the advanced Mocassin curriculum here. You should be proud of yourself! Now, we're going to scroll all the way down to the bottom because there's more to learn.

The most common question we get asked after these courses is "What do I do now?". There's always more to learn, so here are some resources on where to go next.

### Learning More

- Top 10 learning resources
- Patrick Collins
- CryptoZombies
- Alchemy University
- Speed Run Ethereum
- Ethereum.org

### Community

- Twitter
- Ethereum Discord
- Reddit ethdev

### Hackathons

- ETH Global
- CL Hackathon
- ETH India

This is where we need to go and apply our knowledge. 

We've already talked about how to get hired; now it's time to put your knowledge into practice. You definitely want to join the community. If you haven't said hi to me on Twitter, you should say hi! We've had thousands of developers reach out to us who now have full-time jobs in Web3. They've won competitive audits, bug bounties, and have been awarded grants and hackathon wins. You can do it too!

Hackathons are one of the best places to get started. Projects will literally pay you to build stuff for them. It's like being paid to learn; it's a win-win situation! ETH Global is one of our favorites.

### Competitive Audits

Another great option is competitive audits. These are a great way to become a powerful security-minded researcher and a better developer. We recommend checking out CodeHawks.

### First Flights

CodeHawks also has a thing called "First Flights", which are beginner-friendly audit competitions. We've specifically placed some bugs in there that you should be able to find.

If you're looking at Cyfrin Updraft, they have a lot of curriculum, including one of our favorites, the Python and Vyper course. There are also more advanced courses, like Assembly and Formal Verification, Smart Contract DevOps, and Smart Contract Security.  

We also have a course on Curve StableSwap, which is all in Vyper, which you've just learned.  Curve is a multi-billion dollar protocol, and the codebase is used and forked by tons of other projects, so learning Curve will teach you more about other protocols.

In general, be sure to subscribe to anything Cyfrin puts out. We're dedicated to making the lives of developers and security researchers better!
