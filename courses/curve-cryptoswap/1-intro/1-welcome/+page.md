### Welcome To The Curve V2 Cryptoswap AMM Course
Welcome to the course for Curve V2 Cryptoswap AMM. This course is designed for advanced Solidity developers who have experience with Foundry. We assume you have knowledge of Curve V1 stableswap.

In this course, we'll show some examples using Python. However, you won't need to know Python to do the exercises or to understand the key concepts. Why take the course? It might give you some ideas on how to build a new type of AMM. Curve V2 automatically concentrates liquidity using an internal price oracle, that keeps track of the exponential moving average of the tokens. We'll also go over some of the math behind these concepts.

Another motivation to take this course is that you might come across an audit contest or bug bounty that is relevant to Curve V2. Either the smart contract took ideas from Curve V2 or integrates with Curve V2.

In this course, you'll learn the math and the algorithms of Curve V2. Curve V2 is written in Vyper, so we will do a code walkthrough of the Vyper contract. And the exercises will be written in Foundry. What won't be covered in this course, is the advanced math that is used for the calculation of liquidity and swap amounts. The math we'll skip is inside a single library contract that handles these calculations.
