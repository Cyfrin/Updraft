## How To Navigate Through The GitHub Repository

To do the exercises or execute the code examples, we first need to git clone the repo `advanced-defi-2024`. If you are new to GitHub, you can do this by clicking on the green "Code" button, then copying the URL, and then inside your terminal type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/advanced-defi-2024.git
```
Now, for each defi course, there's a readme file. To navigate to the readme, scroll down and then click on one of the links. For example, here we have a readme for Uniswap v2, v3, Curve v1, and Curve v2.

Click on one of the links. This will take you to a readme file where all of the relevant links are included. For example, scrolling down, if you want to play around with the graph that is explained in the video, click on this link. If you wanted to play with the Python code that was explained in the video, click on this link, and so on.

Furthermore, if you want to take a look at the diagrams that are explained in the video, click on the folder called "excalidraw". Here, you will find a raw file called `.excalidraw`. You can open this with the website Excalidraw, or you can open the png file. For example, for Curve v2, click on this and you can see the diagram that is used in the video.

Finally, to execute the exercises, you will need to navigate to a folder called �foundry�. Under �test�, there are exercises for different protocols. For example, for Curve v2, the folder is split into two parts; �exercises� and �solutions�. "Exercises" will contain the file where you will write your code.

After writing the code, you can execute the forge test to make sure that the code you wrote is correct. If you're having trouble, or maybe you just want to see the solution, then you can go over to the solutions folder and then click on one of the files. Here, it will show you the solution.
