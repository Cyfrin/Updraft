## Graphing Constant Product AMM Liquidity

Let's review the constant product AMM, specifically, how changes in liquidity affect the graph of a constant product AMM.

To begin, we have a graph of a constant product AMM in pink, where the liquidity is equal to 5. We will also draw a second constant product AMM, in green, with a liquidity of 5 as well. As we increase the liquidity of the second constant product AMM, we can see the graph of that curve moves in a diagonal direction towards the top right of the screen. We can also see the graph becomes more flat compared to the constant product AMM with less liquidity. 

Now, let's decrease the liquidity of the green graph. We can see that the graph moves towards the bottom left of the screen, towards the origin, x, y = 0, 0. Further, we also notice the curvature increases as liquidity decreases.
