## Removing Liquidity With One Coin

Let's explore how a liquidity provider utilizes the `remove_liquidity_one_coin` function when they want to remove their liquidity in a single token.

When a liquidity provider seeks to remove all of their liquidity at once, they can call the `remove_liquidity` function. This would result in receiving all three tokens - USDC, WBTC, and ETH. However, the `remove_liquidity_one_coin` function allows them to specify and receive their liquidity in a single, preferred token.

For example, consider a pool comprised of USDC, WBTC, and ETH. A liquidity provider might want to remove their liquidity, but only receive ETH. They'll call the `remove_liquidity_one_coin` function and provide their liquidity provider shares (LP shares). The pool contract will then burn these LP shares and calculate the amount of liquidity to return to the user. Since the user has chosen to receive their liquidity in ETH, the pool contract calculates the correct amount of ETH and sends it back to the user.

Users also have the option to receive WETH instead of ETH. If this option is chosen, the pool contract will handle things slightly differently. After the LP shares are returned and the amount of ETH to return to the user is calculated, that ETH will instead be deposited into the WETH contract. The WETH contract will convert the ETH to WETH, and then the pool contract will send this WETH to the user.
