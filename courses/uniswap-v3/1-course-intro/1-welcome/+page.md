### Uniswap V3 Course Introduction

Welcome to the course for Uniswap V3. This course is designed for Solidity developers with experience working with Foundry. To fully understand this course, you should have a basic understanding of a constant product AMM, such as Uniswap V2.

What will we learn?
We will cover the algorithms of Uniswap V3.
- TWAP
- Exercises with Foundry

Some topics we will cover are:
- math for liquidity
- the algorithm for swaps
- the algorithm to calculate the fees for liquidity providers

We will also cover the math and code for time weighted average pricing. There will be several exercises using Foundry.

What won’t we cover?
We will not cover the advanced math library used in Uniswap V3. While we will work a little bit with periphery contracts, the position manager, and the router contract, we will not go into the details of how they work.

Why take the course?
Many of the core math used in Uniswap V4 to calculate liquidity and the swap amount is copied from Uniswap V3. So, by taking this course, you will have a foundational understanding of some of the parts of Uniswap V4.
Another reason to take this course is that you might have ideas for a new AMM. Uniswap V3 is an influential contract, so when you’re doing audit contests and bug bounties, knowing the core mechanics of Uniswap V3 will help.
