### Introduction to Speedrun Ethereum w/ Austin Griffin

Austin Griffin, renowned for his conspicuous bow tie, is eager to help you kickstart your journey of creating on Ethereum through [**speedrunethereum.com**](https://speedrunethereum.com/). He's developed this resource to clarify the ‘HOW’ and ‘WHY’ behind Ethereum building.

Through Speedrun Ethereum, you'll delve into a plethora of projects, including:

- **Creating a simple Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**
- **Constructing a decentralized staking app**
- **Developing a token vendor**
- **Building a Dice Game** - learning about randomness on chain
