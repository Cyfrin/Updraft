Welcome to this exciting lesson, where today we're examining a resource that isn't explicitly part of this course but is highly useful in expanding your knowledge about Ethereum and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This resource comes courtesy of my good friend Austin Griffin. In this blog, he's going to guide you through Speedrun Ethereum, an invaluable tool you might want to explore after finishing this course.

## Introduction to Speedrun Ethereum with Austin Griffin

Austin Griffin, renown for his conspicuous bow tie, is eager to help you kickstart your journey of creating on Ethereum through **Speedrunethereum.com**. He's developed this resource to clarify the ‘HOW’ and ‘WHY’ behind Ethereum building.

Through Speedrun Ethereum, you'll delve into a plethora of projects, including:

• Creating a simple Non-Fungible Token (NFT)• Constructing a decentralized staking app• Exploring the superpower of Ethereum which empowers you to develop a simple set of rules that allow an adversarial group of people to coordinate financially• Developing a token vendor and a dice game• Learning about randomness on chain - where it works and where it doesn't• Uncovering solutions to on-chain randomness challenges• Understanding Dex and Hyperstructure• Learning how people swap liquidity• Briefing on state channel, scalability, sign messages, multisig wallets, account abstraction, and SVG NFTs

## Delving into Scaffold ETH

One of the key takeaways from Speedrun Ethereum is recommends using Scaffold ETH to begin tinkering with your Ethereum project. Before diving in, it's essential to understand how this resource works.

Scaffold ETH, an open-source platform and ideal for dabbling with Solidity, can help you understand the basics. Interestingly, the front-end dynamically adapts to the smart contract, a feature that enormously aids in debugging. A key feature of Scaffold ETH allows you to experiment with each of the concepts of Solidity. For instance, you can test out mappings, Structs, or modifiers by copying and pasting the example into your smart contract. Once deployed, your experimental additions will appear on the screen, giving you real-time feedback on your edits.

Upon deploying this mapping in your smart contract, you'll be able to interact with it. For instance, you can check somebody's (e.g., Vitalik's) balance in your map.

```python
# Checking Vitalik's balance in the map.
```

By inducing this real-time, hands-on practice, it propels you into an iterative learning cycle.

## Final Remarks

Leverage the knowledge and resources provided by speedrun ethereum and Scaffold ETH to equip you in building innovative solutions on Ethereum. With determined effort and continuous learning, you're sure to make significant strides in the blockchain ecosystem.

Happy Bow-Tie Friday,Austin Griffin.

## Congratulations!

That's all for this lesson. To access more in-depth knowledge about blockchain, smart contracts, Solidity, and Ethereum, stay tuned to upcoming lessons!

You have completed the Remix IDE course. You can now move on to the next course, on which were are going to delve into Foundry for Smart Contract Development.
