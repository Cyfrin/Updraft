## Debugging in the Age of AI

From preventing minor glitches to system breakdowns, debugging is an everyday process for all software engineers. In this lesson, we will discuss how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can assist in debugging.

## Pinpointing Your Error

The first step to addressing an issue in your code is to **understand your error**. Be sure to use an AI assistant that can help you figure out the problem.

Here's a key point though. You must have at least a basic understanding of the error otherwise the chances of you understanding the AI solutions become grim.

There's a host of AI tools that you can utilize such as Chat GP  T, Bing's AI, and Google's BERT. However, leveraging the power of AI requires you to follow certain principles:

- Write clear and specific instructions.
- Provide as much context as possible.
- Use delimiters to separate different parts of the input.
- Be on the lookout for 'hallucinations' – instances when the AI concocts an answer that seems right but is incorrect.
- Understand the AI's limitations and adjust accordingly.
- Continuously iterate your questions.

Remember, AI models are trained on human conversations, so interacting with them should feel like a conversation.

Want to perfect your AI question-asking skills? Take a look at this [deep learning AI course](www.example.com), which is designed to assist software engineers in becoming more efficient.

## Reading the Documentation

If you’re unable to receive answers from the AI, it might be beneficial to REFER BACK TO THE DOCUMENTATION. Although this should be your first step, it's never too late to head back and read the manual.

A nifty strategy I use frequently is copy-pasting sections of the documentation into Chat GPT's context. For example, I would ask the AI tool

> The above are the docs for tool "x". Based on those docs, how do I do "y"?

## Use Web Search Tools

There are new tools such as 'Find' that combines AI and web search, effectively providing you with data crawled from the web packaged in the form of an answer.

## Asking in a Web-indexed Forum

If the information isn’t available online, you might need to ask for help from humans. Asking your question on a web-indexed forum such as Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, Piranha, or Reddit allows web crawlers and AI's to scrape data from these sites and learn from us.

Remember, the more questions are asked, the quicker and more accurately AI’s can supply answers in the future.

## Asking on the Support GitHub or Forum

If the tool you’re using is open source, ask a well-formatted question on their GitHub page. Engage with each other, take on issues, and contribute to the open-source code. By this engagement and conversation, we make our tools better.

## Iterate and Repeat

Continually go through these steps as persistence is the key to unblocking software errors.

Finally, a gentle reminder –

Before we part ways, here are a few tips for the course –

1. **Limit your Self-Triage:** Never spend more than 15-20 minutes trying to crack an error. Instead, seek help.
2. **Use AI, but Don’t Skip Learning:** Although AI is a blessing, ignoring your studies isn’t advisable. Be sure to strive for a holistic understanding of the topic at hand.
3. **Make Use of Forums and Google:** Utilize the course discussions channel, ask questions on the forum, and never forget to Google the exact error.
4. **Post your Question in Stack Exchange or Piranha:** In case of unaddressed questions, posting them on online platforms is beneficial. But don’t forget - check to see if your question was previously raised.
5. **Create your GitHub account:** Sharing code is an important part of software engineering and GitHub is where it all happens. Create your account, build your portfolio, and keep it updated with all your exciting projects.

Remember, debugging is a learning process and asking questions is an essential part of it. Feel free to ask away and continually iterate your questions. So sit back, relax, and let AI help you navigate the complex world of software debugging.
