### Introduction

In this lesson, we will explore `SafeMath`, a widely used library before Solidity version 0.8, and understand why its usage has now decreased.

### Integer Overflow

`SafeMath.sol` was a staple in Solidity contracts before version 0.8. After this version, its usage has significantly dropped.

Let's begin by creating a new file called `SafeMathTester.sol` and adding a function `add` that increments the `bigNumber` state variable.

```js
// SafeMathTester.sol
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract SafeMathTester {
    uint8 public bigNumber = 255;

    function add() public {
    bigNumber = bigNumber + 1;
    }
}
```

Notice we are using compiler version `0.6.0`. The `bigNumber` is a `uint8` variable with a maximum value of `255`. If we call the `add` function, it will return `0` instead of the expected `256`.

Before Solidity version **0.8.0**, signed and unsigned integers were **unchecked**, meaning that if they exceeded the maximum value the variable type could hold, they would reset to the lower limit. This pattern is known as **integer overflow** and the `SafeMath` library was designed to prevent it.

### SafeMath

`SafeMath.sol` provided a mechanism to revert transactions when the maximum limit of a `uint256` data type was reached. It was a typical security measure across contracts to avoid erroneous calculations and potential exploits.

```js
function add(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {
    uint c = a + b;
    require(c >= a, "SafeMath: addition overflow");
    return c;
}
```

### Solidity 0.8.0

With the introduction of Solidity version 0.8, automatic checks for overflows and underflows were implemented, making `SafeMath` redundant for these checks. If `SafeMathTester.sol` is deployed with Solidity `0.8.0`, invoking the `add` function will cause a transaction to fail, when, in older versions, it would have reset to zero.

For scenarios where mathematical operations are known not to exceed a variable's limit, Solidity introduced the `unchecked` construct to make code more _gas-efficient_. Wrapping the addition operation with `unchecked` will _ignore the overflow and underflow checks_: if the `bigNumber` exceeds the limit, it will wrap its value to zero.

```js
uint8 public bigNumber = 255;

function add() public {
    unchecked {
    bigNumber = bigNumber + 1;
 }
}
```

> 🔥 **CAUTION** <br>
> It's important to use unchecked blocks with caution as they reintroduce the possibility of overflows and underflows.

### Conclusion

The evolution of Solidity and `SafeMath.sol` highlights the continuous advancements in Ethereum smart contract development. Although recent updates have made `SafeMath.sol` less essential, it remains a significant part of Ethereum's history. Understanding its role provides valuable insight into the progress and maturation of Solidity.
