## Storing and Tracking Favorite Numbers in Our Contract

Our smart contract, as is, does an excellent job. It primarily enables users to store their favorite numbers, update them, and view them later. Sounds brilliant, right? Yet, it has been specifically designed to store a single favorite number at a time. What if we wanted to maintain not just our favorite number, but others as well?

In this lesson, we will explore how we can extend this functionality. We'll learn how to create a list of favorite numbers using arrays. Additionally, we will delve into using `structs` for creating new types in Solidity. Let's get started!

### An Array of Favorite Numbers

The idea is to say goodbye to one `uint256` favorite number and say hello to a list of `uint256` numbers, or in our case, a list of favorite numbers. Here's the magic syntax:

```bash
uint256[] list_of_favorite_numbers;
```

The bracket syntax identifies that we have a list of `uint256`, a list or array of numbers. An array of numbers would look something like this:

```bash
Array_Example_list_of_favorite_numbers = [0, 78, 90];
```

Arrays are very dominant in computer science and programming, and an array in Solidity bears resemblance to an array in any other programming language. If you're new to arrays or lists, remember arrays are zero indexed. The first element starts from index zero, the second from index one, and so on.

### Creating a Struct for `Person`

But an array of numbers is not enough - we wouldn't know whose favorite number is which! We need a way to tie favorite numbers to people. So let's evolve our code by defining a new type `Person` using the `Struct` keyword.

```bash
struct Person {uint256 favorite_number;string name;}
```

Realize the beauty of this new type? Now each `Person` has a favorite number and a name! Remember we need to be particular about scope - don't let your internal variable names clash.

```bash
Renaming to avoid clashuint256 my_favorite_number;
```

We can now create a variable of type `Person` the same way we did for `uint256`. Meet our friend Pat!

```bash
Person public my_friend = Person(7, 'Pat');
```

So, we've now created our own type `Person` and defined Pat who has a favorite number of seven and a name of 'Pat'. We can retrieve these details using the generated getter function thanks to the `public` visibility.

### An Array of `Person`

Creating individual variables for each friend might become a tedious task, especially when we'd like to add a large number of friends. What we can do instead is use the array syntax we've learned and create an array or list of `Person`.

```bash
Person[] public list_of_people;
```

When using a dynamic array, we can add as many `Person` objects as we wish to our list, as the size of the array can now grow and shrink dynamically in Solidity. We can access each `Person` object in our array by its index.

### Adding Persons to the List

Next, we need to create a function that will allow us to add people to our list.

```bash
function add_person(string memory _name, uint256 _favorite_number) public {
    list_of_people.push(Person(_favorite_number, _name));
}
```

`add_person` is a function that takes two variables as input - the name and favorite number of the person. It creates a new `Person` object and adds it to our `list_of_people` array.

### Final Thoughts

With these additions, our Solidity contract is now able to store multiple favorite numbers, each tied to a specific person. When called, our `add_person` function will create a new `Person`, add them to the dynamic array and we can view each person and corresponding favorite number via their array index.

And that's it! We've now gone from a simple contract that stores just one favorite number to one that can handle multiple favorite numbers from different people. Happy coding!
