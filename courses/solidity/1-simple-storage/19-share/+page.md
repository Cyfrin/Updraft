Congratulations! You should be really proud of yourself, and the web3 community is proud of you too. If you have a Twitter account (or create one), weâ€™d love to hear from you.

In the GitHub repository for this course, go to the [Tweet Me](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu?tab=readme-ov-file#-tweet-me-add-your-contract-in) section. Clicking this link will open a tweet, encouraging you to share your success in deploying your first contract to L2.
