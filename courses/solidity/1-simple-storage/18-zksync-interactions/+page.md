> In the zkSync module section `transactions`, you'll find buttons for calling `SimpleStorage` functions like `addPerson`, `listOfPeople`, `nameToFavoriteNumber`, `retrieve`, and `store`. Clicking the blue buttons will display the output in the terminal, while the orange buttons are used for storing values.

For example, when you click the orange `store` button and enter the number `77`, MetaMask will prompt you for confirmation. Once confirmed, you can click `retrieve` to see the stored value. Feel free to experiment with these functions, but keep in mind that the testnet can sometimes be a bit slow.
