### Introduction
In the previous lesson, we added a storage variable `favoriteNumber` within our first smart contract and explored different solidity types. In this lesson, you'll discover how to update and retrieve a storage variable, while also learning about functions, visibility, deployment, transactions, gas usage and variable scope.

### Building the **store** function
📋 To store the `favoriteNumber` variable, we need to implement a new **function**. In Solidity, functions - or methods, are portions of code designed to execute specific tasks within the overall codebase. We'll call this new function `store`, and it will be responsible for updating the `favoriteNumber` variable.
```solidity
contract SimpleStorage {

    uint256 favoriteNumber; // a function will update this variable

    // the function will be written here
}
```
Functions are identified by the keyword `function`, followed by a custom **name** (e.g. "store") and any additional **parameters** enclosed in rounded parentheses `()`.
These parameters represent the values sent to our function. In this case, we inform the `store` function that we want to update `favoriteNumber` with some other value `_favoriteNumber`:
```solidity
contract SimpleStorage {

    uint256 favoriteNumber; // storage variable: it's stored in a section of the blockchain called "Storage"

    function store(uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {
        // the variable favorite number is updated with the value that is contained into the parameter `_favoriteNumber`
        favoriteNumber = _favoriteNumber;
    }
}
```
The content of the function is placed within the curly brackets `{}`.
The prefix `_` before `_favoriteNumber` is used to emphasise that the **_local_** variable `_favoriteNumber` is a **different** variable from the **_state_** variable `favoriteNumber`. This helps prevent potential confusion when dealing with different variables with similar names in complex codebases.

### Deploying the smart contract
You can test out this function in the Remix VM environment.
At this stage, you can compile your code by navigating to the compile tab and hitting Compile. After compiling, navigate to the tab **Deploy and Run Transactions** to test your function.

The **Deploy and Run Transactions** tab holds a variety of parameters that are used during the deployment process.
You'll be assigned an _account_ with some ETH to deploy your smart contract.

In this environment, your contract is assigned a unique address. You can re-access your deployed contract by expanding the **Deployed Contracts** interface and simultaneously opening the terminal, which shows log data of all contract deployments and transactions.

If we open the Remix terminal we can see that deploying the contract has just sent a simulated transaction on the Remix environment. You can check out its details such as status, hash, from, to and gas.

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT** <br>
The process of sending a transaction is the **same** for deploying a contract and for sending Ethers. The only difference is that the machine-readable code of the deployed contract is placed inside the _data_ field of the deployment transaction.

### Transactions creation
Let's send a transaction to the `store` function to change the value of the variable `favoriteNumber`: you can insert a number and press the `store` button in Remix. A transaction is initiated and after some time, its status will change from pending to complete.

💸 From the accounts section, it becomes visible that ETH is being consumed every time a transaction is submitted. When the state of the blockchain is modified (e.g. deploying a contract, sending ETH, ..), is done by sending a transaction that consumes **gas**. Executing the `store` function is more expensive than just transferring ETH between accounts, with the rising gas expenses primarily associated (though not exclusively) with the code length.

#### Verifying the stored value
This contract is missing a way to check if the number has been updated: now we can store a value but we cannot be sure if the transaction **actually** changed the variable value.

The default visibility of the `favoriteNumber` variable is **internal**, preventing external contracts and users from viewing it.

> 🗒️ **NOTE** <br>
Appending the `public` keyword next to a variable will automatically change its visibility and it will generate a **get function**.
```solidity
uint256 public favoriteNumber;
```
After completing compilation and deployment, a button labelled `favoriteNumber` will become visible. When pressed, it should return the most recent stored value of the variable `favoriteNumber`.

#### Visibility
In Solidity, functions and variables can have one of these four visibility specifiers:

- 🌎 **`public`**: accessible from both inside the contract and from external contracts
- 🏠 **`private`**: accessible only within the _current contract_. It does not hide a value but only restricts its access.
- 🌲 **`external`**: used only for *functions*. Visible only from _outside_ the contract. 
- 🏠🏠 **`internal`**: accessible by the current contract and any contracts _derived_ from it.

If a visibility specifier is not given, it defaults to `internal`.

#### Pure and View keywords
The terms `view` and `pure` are used when a function reads values from the blockchain without altering its state. Such functions will not initiate transactions but rather make calls, represented as blue buttons in the Remix interface. A `pure` function will prohibit any reading from the state or storage.

```solidity
function retrieve() public view returns(uint256){
    return favoriteNumber;
}
```

```solidity
function retrieve() public pure returns(uint256){
    return 7;
}
```
<img src="/solidity/remix/lesson-2/functions/blue-button.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

The keyword `returns` specifies the type(s) of value a function will return.

> 🚧 **WARNING** <br>
While calling `view` or `pure` functions doesn’t typically require gas, they do require it when called by another function that modifies the state or storage through a transaction (e.g. calling the function `retrieve` inside the function `storage`). This cost is called **execution cost** and it will add up to the transaction cost.

### The scope of a variable
The scope of a variable refers to the **context** within which it is defined and accessible. This context is usually determined by the block of code, typically enclosed in curly braces `{}`, where the variable is declared. To access the same variable across different functions, it should be declared inside the scope of the main contract.
```solidity
function store(uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {
    favoriteNumber = _favoriteNumber;
    uint256 testVar = 5;
}

function something() public {
   testVar = 6; // will raise a compilation error
   favoriteNumber = 7; // this can be accessed because it's in the main contract scope
}
```

### Conclusion
In this lesson, you have learned how to build a function in Solidity, define its visibility, and understand how it operates on values within a smart contract. You have also explored different transactions and their gas consumption.

### 🧑‍💻 Test yourself
1. 📕 Describe the four visibility keywords and their impact on the code.
2. 📕 What's the difference between `view` and `pure`?
3. 📕 In which circumstances a `pure` function will incur gas costs?
4. 📕 Explain what a *scope* is and provide an example of an incorrect scope.
5. 📕 What's the difference between a transaction that deploys a contract and a transaction that transfers ETH?
6. 🧑‍💻 Write a contract that features 3 functions:
   - a view function that can be accessed only by the current contract
   - a pure function that's not accessible within the current contract
   - a view function that can be accessed from children's contracts
