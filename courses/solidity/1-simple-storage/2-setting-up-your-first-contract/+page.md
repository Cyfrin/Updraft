# Introduction

To get started, we want to open up <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">remix</a>. When you open it up, you'll be greeted with a site that looks like this.

You may select "Accept" or just ignore. 


## Using Remix IDE

Remix IDE is a powerful tool used for developing smart contracts in Solidity. In this section, we will be creating our smart contract and deploying it on a blockchain.

1. Open Remix IDE by either searching on Google or visiting the link provided in the GitHub repository.
2. If it's your first time using Remix, it will provide you a tutorial walkthrough of its features. You can choose to go through it.
3. Clean the environment by right-clicking and deleting the existing folders (optional).
4. Create a new file by clicking on the "create new file" button and give it a name, e.g., SimpleStorage.sol. The `.sol` extension indicates it is a Solidity file.

<!--TODO: Add Support for Solidity on svelte-->

```js
// Your first line in SimpleStorage.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
```

This line specifies the version of Solidity you are using. The caret (^) symbol specifies that the code is compatible with the mentioned version and any new version till (but not including) 0.9.0.

## SPDX License Identifier

It's a good practice to start your smart contract with an SPDX License Identifier. Though it's not mandatory, it helps in making licensing and sharing code easier from a legal perspective.

```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
```

MIT is known as one of the most permissive licenses which means anybody can use this code and pretty much do whatever they want with it.

## Writing the Smart Contract

Start by writing your contract using the keyword `contract`. Give it a name, e.g., SimpleStorage. Everything inside the curly brackets will be considered part of this contract.

```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract SimpleStorage {

}
```

## Compiling the Contract

1. In Remix IDE, select the Solidity Compiler.
2. Choose the version of the compiler that matches the version specified in your Solidity file.
3. Hit the `Compile` button.

Compiling your code means taking human-readable code and transforming it into computer-readable code or bytecode.

If you see a green checkmark, it means your compilation was successful. If there is any error, Remix will point out where the error is, and you can debug it accordingly.

## Congratulations

Technically, you just drafted your first Smart Contract. It's a straightforward operation and the script doesn't do anything yet. However, we're well on our way.
