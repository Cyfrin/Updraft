## Introduction 
In this lesson, you'll discover the basics of Remix and how to create and compile your first contract.

## Remix IDE
Open <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Remix</a> to get started. 

This is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), a powerful tool used to build and develop smart contracts in Solidity. It helps to easily visualize and interact with our smart contracts. It contains a file explorer that hosts all the files, a Solidity compiler and a tab where you can deploy your contracts.

1. üßπ Remove all the existing files and folders by right-clicking on them (optional).
2. ‚ú® Create a new file, e.g., `SimpleStorage.sol`. The `.sol` extension tells the compiler that this is a Solidity file.

## Compiler directive
The `pragma` directive specifies the *version* of the Solidity compiler that you want to use to build your source file. When the compiler encounters this line, it will check its version against the one you specified here. If the compiler version is different, Remix will automatically adjust accordingly to your specifications. 

You can specify the compiler version(s) in the following ways:

1 use exactly **one** version 
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.19; // use only version 0.8.19
```
2 use versions that fall **within** a lower and upper range
```solidity
// use versions between 0.8.19 and 0.9.0 (excluded)
pragma solidity ^0.8.19; 
pragma solidity  >=0.8.19 < 0.9.0;
```
üóíÔ∏è **NOTE** <br>
Remember to write comments in your code for you to refer to later on.

## SPDX License Identifier
It's a good practice (even not mandatory) to start your smart contract with an SPDX License Identifier. It helps in making licensing and sharing code easier from a legal perspective.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
```
MIT is known as one of the most permissive licenses which means anybody can use this code and pretty much do whatever they want with it.

## Writing the Smart Contract
Start by writing your contract using the keyword `contract`. Give it a name, e.g., `SimpleStorage`. All the code inside the curly brackets will be considered part of this contract.

If you are familiar with Object Oriented Programming Languages, you can think of a *contract* as a concept similar to a *class*.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract SimpleStorage {
    //here we'll place the content of the contract
}
```

## Compiling
1. In Remix IDE, select the Solidity Compiler.
2. Choose the version of the compiler that matches the version specified in your Solidity file.
3. Hit the `Compile` button.

Compiling your code means taking human-readable code and transforming it into computer-readable code or bytecode.

If you see a green checkmark, it means your compilation was successful. If there is any error, Remix will point out where the error is, and you can debug it accordingly.

## Congratulations
Well done! You just created and compiled your first smart contract in olidity.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Test yourself
1. üìï What does IDE mean and what are Remix main features?
2. üìï What's the keywork `pragma` used for?
3. üßë‚Äçüíª Write an empty contract that contains a SPDX License Identifier and compiles with version 0.8.11 or 0.8.13.
