We've all been there. Staring blankly at a line of code and scratching our heads, trying to make sense of it. Sometimes a new concept or technique can trip us up. And it's not really surprisingâ€”the world of programming and technology is vast and constantly evolving and, sooner or later, we're bound to hit a roadblock.

But fret not. Because AI is here to save the day. More specifically, AI chat platforms like **ChatGPT** and **Bard**. They can be a helpful resource to gain clarity when we're navigating the rocky terrain of programming.

However, remember that 'how' you ask questions can significantly impact the clarity and effectiveness of the answers.

## Ask Questions the Right Way

Let's say you come across a line of code and can't quite understand the difference between two instances of `SimpleStorage`. Here's how you can formulate a question for the AI:

1. Open ChatGPT or any other AI chatbot platform you prefer.
2. Start with a simple and straightforward query like:
   
    `"Hi, I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between these simple storages on this line."`
3. Highlight **only the line** you're confused about and copy it.
4. Paste this line of code within your question in a block format. In markdown, you can create a block by adding three backticks `"`````"` before and after the block of text or code.

```
    ```
    // paste your line of code here
    ```
```

This signifies that it is a block of code and makes it easier for the AI to understand.

5. If your code is small enough, you can paste the **entire code** as well, but remember to mark it as a code block too. Some AI may struggle to handle large amounts of code, so try to be as concise as possible.
    
    Here's an example of how it would look:

```
Hi, I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between these simple storages on this line:
```

```
```// paste the confusing line of code here```
```

```
Here is my full code:
```

```
```// paste the full code here```
```


Now, just hit "Send" and let the AI do its magic!## Interpreting AI Responses

The AI can provide insightful answers to help unravel the mysteries of your code. For instance, with the `SimpleStorage` example, an AI may indicate that "simple storage is a variable of type simple storage, which is a contract defined in simple storage.sol". If all goes well, this should help clarify any doubts you might have. 

> "A lot of this beginner basic stuff AIS are really good at. As we get more and more advanced, AIs are going to start breaking apart. But at least for the beginning, AIs are going to be incredibly helpful and incredibly good at explaining a lot."From the basic to the more advanced stuff, you can lean on the AI chat as a "learning buddy".

## Not Always Right

Despite their overwhelming benefits, remember that AI chat platforms are not infallible. They can, and do, get things wrong or misunderstood sometimes. When that happens, don't lose hope! You can engage other platforms like [Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/), or the discussion forums related to the course or topic you're studying.For instance, when querying about `SimpleStorage`, an AI response might refer to a 'stored data variable', which doesn't exist in the code you provided. Don't panic! It's just an example of how AI's often work on context-based inference and may sometimes link to unrelated concepts.

Stay patient, stay curious, and keep learning!
