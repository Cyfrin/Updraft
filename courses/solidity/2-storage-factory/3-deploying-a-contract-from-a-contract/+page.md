title: Deploying a Contract from a Contract (Factory)
---

_You can follow along with the video course from here._

### Introduction

This lesson covers the process of **programmatically deploying** a `SimpleStorage` contract and saving it to a _storage or state variable_. By the end of this lesson, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how one contract can seamlessly deploy and manage another one.

### Creating a new variable

Following the format _type-visibility-name_, we can declare a new _state variable_ of type `SimpleStorage`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract StorageFactory {
    SimpleStorage public simpleStorage;

    function createSimplestorageContract() public {
        simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
    }
}
```

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT**:br 
> `SimpleStorage` on the left and `simpleStorage` on the right are treated as entirely distinct entities due to their differing capitalization. `Simple Storage` refers to the contract type while `simpleStorage` refers to the variable name.

When the `new` keyword is used, the compiler recognizes the intention to deploy a new contract instance. After compiling, we can proceed to deploy it.

In Remix, you'll then notice two buttons: an orange `createSimpleStorageContract` and a blue one, `SimpleStorage`, generated by the `public` keyword. If we call both, first `createSimpleStorageContract` and then `SimpleStorage`, the address that appears below confirms that our `SimpleStorage` contract has been deployed.

### Conclusion

We have just deployed a contract that can programmatically create another contract, showing the principle of _composability_. In this way, contracts can know and interact with each other seamlessly.

### 🧑‍💻 Test yourself

1. 📕 What does the `new` keyword tell to the compiler?
2. 🧑‍💻 Create a contract `AnimalFactory` that includes a function `createAnimals`. This function must be capable of deploying the other 2 contracts `Cows` and `Birds`, which are simple contracts with just a constructor method.
