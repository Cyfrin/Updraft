title: Interacting with Contracts ABI
---



Let's assume that every time we call `createSimpleStorageContract()`, we're deploying a new Simple Storage Contract. But there's a catch – we're not keeping track of all the addresses that this simple storage contract is being deployed to. Let's fix that.

### Solution: A Running List of Contracts

A better approach is to transform our variable into a list or an array of Simple Storage Contracts. This way, whenever a contract is created, it gets added to our list. Renaming the new list as `listOfSimpleStorageContracts` gives us a dynamic array for contract storage.

```dart
 SimpleStorage[] public listOfSimpleStorageContracts;
```

Now, whenever a new contract is deployed, it gets pushed to this dynamic array.

```js
function createSimpleStorageContract() public {
        SimpleStorage simpleStorageContractVariable = new SimpleStorage();
        listOfSimpleStorageContracts.push(simpleStorageContractVariable);
    }
```

Once compiled and deployed you will be able to interact with the contract like so:

```js
StorageFactory storageFactory = new StorageFactory();
storageFactory.createSimpleStorageContract();
```

On the deployed contract, you should be able to access `listOfSimpleStorageContracts` which now has a `uint256` input allowing you to choose the index of the variable to interact with.


### Interacting with Smart Contracts

Our `StorageFactory` contract can be considered as the manager of all the Simple Storage Contracts. Up next, we'll discuss how our `StorageFactory` contract can call the `store` function of the simple storage that it deploys. To make this happen, we create a function called SF Store.

```js
function sfStore(uint _simpleStorageIndex, uint _simpleStorageNumber) public {...}
```

Whenever you interact with another contract, you need two things – an address and the ABI (Application Binary Interface). A simple rule of thumb to remember is ABI and address are key for contract interaction. The ABI works like a user manual, guiding code interaction with other contracts.

If you go to Solidity's compile tab and scroll down, you will find a button to copy the ABI to clipboard. This ABI provides compilation details and helps define how to interact with the contract.

Essentially, the buttons you see upon deploying a contract are the same as the ones you see inside the ABI. The presence and quantity of buttons is determined by the ABI.

In our case, the ABI is automatically known to the compiler because the compiler generates it for Solidity. We also know the address because we have a list of all of them. Now, with the ABI and the address at our disposal, we can interact with other contracts with ease.

Let's use the `SFstore` function to store a new number on one of those simple storage contracts using the index in our array:

```js
listOfSimpleStorageContracts[_simpleStorageIndex].store(
            _simpleStorageNumber
        );
```

It is also possible to retrieve the stored value from our Simple Storage contract:

```js
function sfGet(uint256 _simpleStorageIndex) public view returns (uint256) {
        // return SimpleStorage(address(simpleStorageArray[_simpleStorageIndex])).retrieve();
        return listOfSimpleStorageContracts[_simpleStorageIndex].retrieve();
    }
```

After compiling these newly added features and deploying the contract, you will be able to interact with your contract in the expected manner:



In conclusion, we have built a contract `StorageFactory` that creates `SimpleStorage` contracts and allows for interaction (saving and retrieving data) with these contracts. As a final touch, we can simplify the `SfGet` and `sfStore` functions as below:

```js
 function sfStore(
        uint256 _simpleStorageIndex,
        uint256 _simpleStorageNumber
    ) public {
        
        listOfSimpleStorageContracts[_simpleStorageIndex].store(
            _simpleStorageNumber
        );
    }
```

By leveraging the capacities of the Solidity language, we can construct and manage a dynamic array of contracts, and interact with them seamlessly. Keep exploring and happy coding!
