### Deploying and testing our lottery

Now that we've got all the prerequisites for deployment let's proceed in deploying the raffle.

Let's open the `DeployRaffle.s.sol` and use our new tools.

First, import the newly created HelperConfig.

`import {HelperConfig} from "./HelperConfig.s.sol";`

Then, modify the run function:

```solidity
function run() external returns (Raffle, HelperConfig) {
    HelperConfig helperConfig = new HelperConfig(); // This comes with our mocks!
    (
        uint256 entranceFee;
        uint256 interval;
        address vrfCoordinator;
        bytes32 gasLane;
        uint64 subscriptionId;
        uint32 callbackGasLimit;

    ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();

}
```

Great! Now that we have deconstructed the NetworkConfig we have all the variables we need to deploy::

```solidity
vm.startBroadcast();
Raffle raffle = new Raffle(
    entranceFee,
    interval,
    vrfCoordinator,
    gasLane,
    subscriptionId,
    callbackGasLimit
)
vm.stopBroadcast();

return raffle;
```

We use the `vm.startBroadcast` and `vm.stopBroadcast` commands to indicate that we are going to send a transaction. The transaction is the deployment of a new `Raffle` contract using the parameters we've obtained from the `HelperConfig`. In the end, we are returning the newly deployed contract.

This code is good on its own, but, we can make it better. For example, we need a `subscriptionId`. We can either obtain this through the front end as we've learned in a previous lesson, or we can get on programmatically. For now, we'll leave everything as is, but we will refactor this in the future.

Before that, let's write some tests.

Inside the `test` folder create two new folders called `integration` and `unit`. Here we'll put our integration and unit tests. Inside the newly created `unit` folder create a file called `RaffleTest.t.sol`.

Let's start writing the first test. You've already done this at least two times in this section. Try to do it on your own and come back when you get stuck.

Your unit test should start like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import {DeployRaffle} from "../../script/DeployRaffle.s.sol";
import {Raffle} from "../../src/Raffle.sol";
import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {HelperConfig} from "../../script/HelperConfig.s.sol";

contract RaffleTest is Test {

}
```

We've declared the SPDX-License-Identifier, the solidity version, imported the `DeployRaffle` which we will use to deploy our contract, then `Raffle` the contract to be deployed and then `Test` and `console` which are required for Foundry to function.

In `DeployRaffle.s.sol` we need to make sure that `run` also returns the `HelperConfig` contract:

```solidity
function run() external returns (Raffle, HelperConfig) {
    HelperConfig helperConfig = new HelperConfig();
    (
        uint256 entranceFee,
        uint256 interval,
        address vrfCoordinator,
        bytes32 gasLane,
        uint64 subscriptionId,
        uint32 callbackGasLimit
    ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();

    vm.startBroadcast();
    Raffle raffle = new Raffle(
        entranceFee,
        interval,
        vrfCoordinator,
        gasLane,
        subscriptionId,
        callbackGasLimit
    );
    vm.stopBroadcast();

    return (raffle, helperConfig);
}
```

Next comes the state variables and `setUp` function in `RaffleTest.t.sol`:


```solidity
contract RaffleTest is Test {

    Raffle public raffle;
    HelperConfig public helperConfig;

    uint256 entranceFee;
    uint256 interval;
    address vrfCoordinator;
    bytes32 gasLane;
    uint64 subscriptionId;
    uint32 callbackGasLimit;

    address public PLAYER = makeAddr("player");
    uint256 public constant STARTING_USER_BALANCE = 10 ether;

    function setUp() external {
        DeployRaffle deployer = new DeployRaffle();
        (raffle, helperConfig) = deployer.run();
        vm.deal(PLAYER, STARTING_USER_BALANCE);

        (
            entranceFee,
            interval,
            vrfCoordinator,
            gasLane,
            subscriptionId,
            callbackGasLimit

        ) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();
    }
}
```


This seems like a lot, but it isn't, let's go through it.


- We made `RaffleTest` contract inherit `Test` to enable the testing functionality;
- We've defined a `raffle` and `helperConfig` variables to store the contracts;
- Next, we defined the variables required for the deployment;
- Then, we created a new user called `PLAYER` and defined how many tokens they should receive;
- Inside the `setUp` function, we deploy the `DeployRaffle` contract then we use it to deploy the `Raffle` and `HelperConfig` contracts;
- We `deal` the `PLAYER` the defined `STARTING_USER_BALANCE`;
- We call `helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig` to get the Raffle configuration parameters.

Amazing! With all these done let's write a small test to ensure our `setUp` is functioning properly.

First, we need a getter function to retrieve the raffle state. Put the following towards the end of the `Raffle.sol`:

```solidity
function getRaffleState() public view returns (RaffleState) {
    return s_raffleState;
}
```

Inside `RaffleTest.t.sol` paste the following test:

```solidity
function testRaffleInitializesInOpenState() public view {
    assert(raffle.getRaffleState() == Raffle.RaffleState.OPEN);
}
```
**Note**: we used `Raffle.RaffleState.OPEN` to get the value attributed to `OPEN` inside the `RaffleState` enum. This is possible because `RaffleState` is considered a [type](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#enums). So we can access that by calling the type `RaffleState` inside a `Raffle` contract to retrieve the `OPEN` value. 

Great! Let's run the test and see how it goes:

`forge test --mt testRaffleInitializesInOpenState -vv`

The output being:

```
Ran 1 test for test/unit/RaffleTest.t.sol:RaffleTest
[PASS] testRaffleInitializesInOpenState() (gas: 7707)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 12.42ms (51.80Âµs CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 2.25s (12.42ms CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

Ok, so our Raffle starts in an OPEN state. Exactly like we coded it!

Great job! We started testing, let's see what we can do next!
