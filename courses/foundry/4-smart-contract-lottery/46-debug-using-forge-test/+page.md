### Debugging using the forge debug tool

One other tool that we didn't properly introduce until now is `forge test --debug`.

Run `forge test --debug testRaffleRecordsPlayerWhenTheyEnter`.

I know this looks a bit scary, but it isn't!

In this view, you can go OPCODE by OPCODE to check each super granular step of your function execution. It's something that it's not recommended to do at the beginning of your developer journey. But with time, after you accumulate some more knowledge and maybe finish the Section about Yul, Huff and OPCODES, you will be super comfortable. I guarantee it!

For now, just know how to access this view.
