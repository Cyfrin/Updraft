Okay, here's a thorough and detailed summary of the video segment (0:00 - 2:27) on "Custom Errors With Parameters" in Solidity:

**Overall Topic:** The video explains how and why to add parameters to custom errors in Solidity to provide more specific and useful information when a transaction reverts. This is demonstrated within the context of a Raffle smart contract integrated with Chainlink Keepers (Automation) and VRF (Verifiable Random Function).

**Problem Addressed:**
*   Standard `revert()` statements without any message or identifier are very unhelpful for debugging. If a transaction fails with a plain `revert()`, users or developers have little immediate information about *why* it failed.
*   Even basic custom errors (like `error Raffle_RaffleNotOpen();`) are better, but they might still lack sufficient context in complex scenarios.

**Context: Raffle Contract and `performUpkeep`**
*   The specific code being examined is within the `performUpkeep` function of a `Raffle.sol` contract.
*   This function is designed to be called by Chainlink Keepers (now Chainlink Automation).
*   It first calls `checkUpkeep` to determine if the necessary conditions are met to proceed (e.g., time interval passed, raffle is open, contract has balance, there are players).
*   If `checkUpkeep` returns `false` (meaning `upkeepNeeded` is false), the `performUpkeep` function should revert, as there's nothing for it to do.

**Initial (Problematic) Code:**
```solidity
// Inside function performUpkeep(bytes calldata /* performData */) external
// ...
(bool upkeepNeeded, ) = checkUpkeep("");
if (!upkeepNeeded) {
    revert(); // <-- Problematic: Uninformative revert
}
// ... rest of the function requests randomness via VRF
```

**Solution: Custom Error with Parameters**

1.  **Identify the Need for More Information:** When `!upkeepNeeded` is true, simply reverting doesn't tell the caller *which* of the conditions checked within `checkUpkeep` failed (time, open state, balance, players).
2.  **Define a New Custom Error with Parameters:** A new custom error `Raffle_UpkeepNotNeeded` is defined at the top of the contract. Crucially, it includes parameters representing the state variables that influence the `upkeepNeeded` check.
    ```solidity
    /* Errors */
    error Raffle_SendMoreToEnterRaffle();
    error Raffle_TransferFailed();
    error Raffle_RaffleNotOpen();
    error Raffle_UpkeepNotNeeded(uint256 balance, uint256 playersLength, uint256 raffleState); // <-- New error definition
    ```
    *   `uint256 balance`: Represents the contract's current ETH balance (`address(this).balance`).
    *   `uint256 playersLength`: Represents the number of players currently entered (`s_players.length`).
    *   `uint256 raffleState`: Represents the current state of the raffle (e.g., OPEN or CALCULATING).

3.  **Implement the Revert with Parameters:** The plain `revert()` is replaced with a `revert` statement that calls the new custom error and passes the relevant current state values as arguments.
    ```solidity
    // Inside function performUpkeep(bytes calldata /* performData */) external
    // ...
    (bool upkeepNeeded, ) = checkUpkeep("");
    if (!upkeepNeeded) {
        // Revert with specific state information
        revert Raffle_UpkeepNotNeeded(
            address(this).balance,      // Current balance
            s_players.length,          // Current number of players
            uint256(s_raffleState)     // Current raffle state (cast from enum)
        );
    }
    // ... rest of the function
    ```

**Key Concepts and Relationships:**

*   **Custom Errors:** Introduced in Solidity 0.8.4, they are a more gas-efficient way to handle errors compared to `require` statements with string messages. They use error signatures similar to function signatures.
*   **Parameters in Custom Errors:** Allow developers to pass specific data along with the revert, providing valuable context about the contract's state at the moment the error occurred. This significantly aids debugging.
*   **`revert` Opcode:** Stops execution, reverts state changes made within the current call, returns unused gas, and can optionally return data (like custom error data).
*   **Chainlink Keepers/Automation:** Off-chain nodes that monitor smart contracts and call specific functions (like `performUpkeep`) when predefined conditions (checked by `checkUpkeep`) are met. The custom error helps understand why a Keeper might *not* execute the main logic of `performUpkeep`.
*   **Chainlink VRF:** Used by the raffle contract (within `performUpkeep` when upkeep *is* needed) to securely get a random number for picking a winner. The error handling ensures VRF isn't requested unnecessarily.
*   **Enums (`RaffleState`):** User-defined types that restrict a variable to a set of predefined constants (e.g., `OPEN`, `CALCULATING`). Under the hood, they map to unsigned integers (0, 1, 2,...).
*   **Type Casting (`uint256(s_raffleState)`):** Because the `Raffle_UpkeepNotNeeded` error expects a `uint256` for the state, the `RaffleState` enum variable `s_raffleState` needs to be explicitly converted (cast) to `uint256` when passed as an argument. The video notes that `OPEN` would become `0` and `CALCULATING` would become `1`.

**Notes and Tips:**

*   Always prefer custom errors over plain `revert()` or `require()` with long strings for better gas efficiency and error handling.
*   When designing custom errors, think about what state information would be most useful for debugging the specific condition causing the revert.
*   Remember that enums map to integers, and you might need to cast them when interacting with functions or errors expecting standard integer types.

**Use Case/Example:**
The primary use case demonstrated is providing detailed debugging information for the `performUpkeep` function. If a Chainlink Keeper calls `performUpkeep` but it reverts, checking the transaction failure details will now show the `Raffle_UpkeepNotNeeded` error along with the contract's balance, number of players, and raffle state at that time. This allows someone to quickly diagnose *why* upkeep wasn't needed (e.g., "Ah, the balance was 0", or "The raffle state was still CALCULATING").

**Minor Code Cleanup Mentioned:**
Towards the end (around 2:04), the speaker briefly removes the `uint256 requestId =` variable assignment and comments out the `requestId` parameter in the `fulfillRandomWords` function signature to clear compiler warnings, stating it will likely be added back later. This is a temporary cleanup unrelated to the main topic of custom error parameters.

In summary, this segment effectively teaches the value and implementation of adding parameters to Solidity custom errors, using a practical example within a Chainlink-integrated smart contract to make debugging revert reasons much clearer.
