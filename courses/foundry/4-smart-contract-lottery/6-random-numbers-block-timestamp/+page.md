### Prerequisites for picking a winner

Going back to [lesson 1](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry/smart-contract-lottery/setup), we established that one of the Raffle contract goals is `...we should be able to automatically pick a winner out of the registered users.`

What do we need to do that?

1. A random number
2. Use the random number to pick a winning player
3. Call `pickWinner` automatically

For now, let's focus on points 1 and 2. But before diving straight into the randomness let's think a bit about the Raffle design. We don't have any problem with anyone calling `pickWinner`. As long as someone wants to pay the gas associated with that they are more than welcome to do it. But we need to make sure that a decent amount of time passed since the start of the raffle. We don't want to host a 10-second raffle where two people get to register and then someone calls the `pickWinner`. In that sense, we need to define a new state variable called `i_interval` which represents the duration of a raffle:

```solidity
contract Raffle {

    error Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent();

    uint256 private immutable i_entranceFee;
    // @dev Duration of the lottery in seconds
    uint256 private immutable i_interval;
    address payable[] private s_players;

    event EnteredRaffle(address indexed player);

    constructor(uint256 entranceFee, uint256 interval) {
        i_entranceFee = entranceFee;
        i_interval = interval;
    }
}
```

Now that we have defined a raffle duration, we need to check it in `pickWinner`, but check it against what? We need to check it against the difference between the moment in time when the raffle started and the moment in time when the function `pickWinner` is called. But for that, we need to record the raffle starting time.

Perform the following update:

```solidity
contract Raffle{

    error Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent();

    uint256 private immutable i_entranceFee;
    // @dev Duration of the lottery in seconds
    uint256 private immutable i_interval;
    address payable[] private s_players;
    uint256 private s_lastTimeStamp;

    event EnteredRaffle(address indexed player);

    constructor(uint256 entranceFee, uint256 interval) {
        i_entranceFee = entranceFee;
        i_interval = interval;
        s_lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
    }
}
```

And now we have all the prerequisites to perform the check:

```solidity
// 1. Get a random number
// 2. Use the random number to pick a player
// 3. Automatically called
function pickWinner() external {
    // check to see if enough time has passed
    if (block.timestamp - s_lastTimeStamp < interval) revert();
}
```

Don't worry! We will create a custom error for that in the next lesson. But before that let's talk randomness.
