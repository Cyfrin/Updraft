### Introduction

In this lesson we are going to build a couple more tests. If we check our code coverage with `forge coverage`, the terminal will show that we are only at around 53% coverage for the `Raffle.sol` contract. Code coverage refers to the percentage of lines of code that have been tested.

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP**:br
> Achieving 100% coverage isn't always required, but it is a recommended target.

### `checkUpkeep` tests

To improve our coverage, we need to write additional tests. For example we can address the `checkUpkeep` function, to ensure it really executes as intended under various circumstances.

1. Letâ€™s start by ensuring that `checkUpkeep` returns `false` when there is no balance. Weâ€™ll do this by setting up our test environment similarly to previous tests but without entering the raffle. Hereâ€™s the code:

   ```solidity
   function testCheckUpkeepReturnsFalseIfItHasNoBalance() public {
           // Arrange
           vm.warp(block.timestamp + automationUpdateInterval + 1);
           vm.roll(block.number + 1);

           // Act
           (bool upkeepNeeded,) = raffle.checkUpkeep("");

           // Assert
           assert(!upkeepNeeded);
    }
   ```

2. Next, we want to assert that `checkUpkeep` returns `false` when the raffle is in a _not open_ state. To do this, we can use a setup similar to our previous test:
   ```solidity
   function testCheckUpkeepReturnsFalseIfRaffleIsntOpen() public {
           // Arrange
           vm.prank(PLAYER);
           raffle.enterRaffle{value: raffleEntranceFee}();
           vm.warp(block.timestamp + automationUpdateInterval + 1);
           vm.roll(block.number + 1);
           raffle.performUpkeep("");
           Raffle.RaffleState raffleState = raffle.getRaffleState();

           // Act
           (bool upkeepNeeded,) = raffle.checkUpkeep("");

           // Assert
           assert(raffleState == Raffle.RaffleState.CALCULATING);
           assert(upkeepNeeded == false);
    }
   ```

### Conclusion

By writing these additional tests, we enhance our test coverage rate, improve the reliability of our `Raffle.sol` contract, and check that `checkUpkeep` behaves correctly under various conditions.
