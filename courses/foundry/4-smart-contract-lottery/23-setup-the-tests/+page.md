### Continuing our testing journey

Let's jump straight into testing! But where do we start?

Easy! Let's call `forge coverage`:

```
Analysing contracts...
Running tests...

| ------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

| script/HelperConfig.s.sol | 0.00% (0/9)   | 0.00% (0/13)   | 0.00% (0/2)   | 0.00% (0/2)   |
| src/Raffle.sol            | 2.94% (1/34)  | 2.33% (1/43)   | 0.00% (0/8)   | 7.69% (1/13)  |
| Total                     | 16.00% (8/50) | 15.38% (10/65) | 0.00% (0/10)  | 12.50% (2/16) |
```

These numbers are weak! Let's improve them!

Open the `RaffleTest.t.sol` inside the `test/unit` folder.

In my opinion, when one needs to decide where to start testing there are two sensible approaches one could take:

1. Easy to Complex - start with view functions, then with smaller functions and advance to the more complex functions;
2. From the main entry point(s) to the periphery - what is the main functionality that the external user needs to call in order to interact with your contract;

Patrick chose number 2. So what is the main entry point of our Raffle contract? The `enterRaffle` function.

Let's look closely at it:

```solidity
function enterRaffle() external payable {
    if(msg.value < i_entranceFee) revert Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent();
    if (s_raffleState != RaffleState.OPEN) revert Raffle__RaffleNotOpen();

    s_players.push(payable(msg.sender));
    emit EnteredRaffle(msg.sender);
}
```

1. We check if the `msg.value` is high enough;
2. We check if the `RaffleState` is `OPEN`;
3. If all of the above are `true` then the `msg.sender` should be pushed in the `s_players` array;
4. Our function emits the `EnteredRaffle` event.

Let's test point 1:

```solidity
function testRaffleRevertsWHenYouDontPayEnough() public {
    // Arrange
    vm.prank(PLAYER);
    // Act / Assert
    vm.expectRevert(Raffle.Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent.selector);
    raffle.enterRaffle();
}
```

We call `vm.prank(PLAYER)` to configure the fact that the next transaction will be called by the `PLAYER`. [Refresher](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/prank?highlight=prank#prank)

After that we use the `vm.expectRevert` [cheatcode](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/expect-revert?highlight=expectRevert#expectrevert) to test if the next call will revert. We also have the option to specify the error message. You can do that by calling the `errorName.selector` as input of the `vm.expectRevert` cheatcode. Following that we call the `enterRaffle` without specifying the `value` of the transaction.

Run the test using `forge test --mt testRaffleRevertsWHenYouDontPayEnough`.

```
Ran 1 test for test/unit/RaffleTest.t.sol:RaffleTest
[PASS] testRaffleRevertsWHenYouDontPayEnough() (gas: 10865)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 1.99ms (161.70Âµs CPU time)
```

We will skip point 2 for now, let's go straight to point 3:

But before being able to test if a player is properly recorded in the `s_players` array we first need a view function to access the players in the `s_players`:

```solidity
function getPlayer(uint256 index) public view returns (address) {
    return s_players[index];
}
```
Now that we have all the tools we need:

```solidity
function testRaffleRecordsPlayerWhenTheyEnter() public {
    // Arrange
    vm.prank(PLAYER);
    // Act
    raffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}();
    // Assert
    address playerRecorded = raffle.getPlayer(0);
    assert(playerRecorded == PLAYER);
}
```

We start by pranking the PLAYER, then properly calling the `enterRaffle` function specifying the correct `value`. We call the new `getPLayer` function to copy the player recorded at index 0 in memory. Then we compare that value to the `PLAYER` address to ensure they match.

Test it with the following command: `forge test --mt testRaffleRecordsPlayerWhenTheyEnter`.

Amazing work! Let's continue in the next lesson! We are going to learn how to test events in Foundry.
