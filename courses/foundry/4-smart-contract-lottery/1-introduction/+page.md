Welcome to Section 9 of this course! You can code along by following the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-smart-contract-lottery-cu) associated with this section. This project will be a valuable addition to your portfolio, as we'll develop a **Verifiably Random Lottery Smart Contract** that contains a lot of best coding practices.

> 🗒️ **NOTE**:
> We won't be deploying this to ZKsync because of current integration constraints.

In this lesson, we will cover **events**, **true random numbers**, **modules**, and **automation**. You can preview the final project by cloning the repository and checking the `makefile`, which lists all the specific versions of dependencies needed to compile our contract.

The main contract that we'll work on will be `src/Raffle.sol`. It contains detailed comments and professional-looking NAT spec, such as:

```solidity
/**
 * @title A sample Raffle Contract
 * @notice This contract is for creating a sample raffle contract
 * @dev This implements the Chainlink VRF Version 2
 */
```

This smart contract allows for a **fully automated** Smart Contract Lottery where users can buy a lottery ticket by entering a raffle. Functions like `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` will automate the lottery process, ensuring the system runs without manual intervention.

We'll use **Chainlink VRF** version 2.5 for randomness. The `fulfillRandomWords` function will handle the selection of the random winner and reset the lottery, ensuring a provably fair system.

We'll also write advanced **scripts** that you can find inside the `makefile`. These include various commands to interact with the smart contract, such as creating subscriptions and adding a consumer.

Let's dive in and start building this exciting project!
