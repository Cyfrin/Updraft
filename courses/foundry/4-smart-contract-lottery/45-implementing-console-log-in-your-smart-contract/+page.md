### Debugging using console log

Do you remember how inside our `Raffle.t.sol` we did `import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";` to import the console? And then again, we did the same thing inside the Script files? This is not limited only to testing and scripting. Let's demonstrate:

1. Add the following in the import section of your `Raffle.sol` file: `import {console} from "forge-std/Script.sol";`
2. Change the `enterRaffle` function as follows:

```solidity
function enterRaffle() public payable {
    if (s_raffleState == RaffleState.CALCULATING) revert Raffle__RaffleNotOpen();
    if (msg.value < i_entranceFee) revert Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent();
    console.log("Debugging at its finest");
    s_players.push(payable(msg.sender));

    emit EnteredRaffle(msg.sender);
}
```

3. Run `forge test --mt testRaffleRecordsPlayerWhenTheyEnter -vv`.

The result:

```
Ran 1 test for test/unit/RaffleTest.t.sol:RaffleTest
[PASS] testRaffleRecordsPlayerWhenTheyEnter() (gas: 71482)

You can see the `Debugging at its finest` message at the end of the log. Super nice!

**Note:** Make sure to delete those before deploying to mainnet, because this will cost gas, and you do not want to spend that!
