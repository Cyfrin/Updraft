### Getting Started with Chainlink VRF


> 🗒️ **NOTE**:
> This written lesson uses VRF V2. Video lesson uses VRF V2.5. There are
some changes. Import path for VRF contract is slightly different, and the
`requestRandomWords()` parameter is slightly different**

Continuing the previous lesson, let's integrate Chainlink VRF into our Raffle project.


Coming back to our `pickWinner` function.

```solidity
// 1. Get a random number
// 2. Use the random number to pick a player
// 3. Automatically called
function pickWinner() external {
    // check to see if enough time has passed
    if (block.timestamp - s_lastTimeStamp < i_interval) revert();
}
```
Let's focus on points 1 and 2. In the previous lesson, we learned that we need to request a `randomWord` and Chainlink needs to callback one of our functions to answer the request. Let's copy the `requestId` line from the [Chainlink VRF docs](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/subscription/examples/get-a-random-number#analyzing-the-contract) example inside our `pickWinner` function and start fixing the missing dependencies.

```solidity
function pickWinner() external {
    // check to see if enough time has passed
    if (block.timestamp - s_lastTimeStamp < i_interval) revert();

    uint256 requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords(
        keyHash,
        s_subscriptionId,
        requestConfirmations,
        callbackGasLimit,
        numWords
    );
}
```

You know the `keyHash`, `subId`, `requestConfirmations`, `callbackGasLimit` and `numWords` from our previous lesson.

Ok, starting from the beginning what do we need?

1. We need to establish the fact that our `Raffle` contract is a consumer of Chainlink VRF;
2. We need to take care of the VRF Coordinator, define it as an immutable variable and give it a value in the constructor;

Let's add the following imports:
```solidity
import {VRFCoordinatorV2Interface} from "chainlink/src/v0.8/vrf/interfaces/VRFCoordinatorV2Interface.sol";
import {VRFConsumerBaseV2} from "chainlink/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol";
```

Let's make our contract inherit the `VRFConsumerBaseV2`:

```solidity
contract Raffle is VRFConsumerBaseV2
```

Add a new immutable variable:
```solidity
// Chainlink VRF related variables
address immutable i_vrfCoordinator;
```
I've divided the `Raffle` variables from the `Chainlink VRF` variables to keep the contract tidy.

Adjust the constructor to accommodate all the new variables and imports:

```solidity
constructor(uint256 entranceFee, uint256 interval, address vrfCoordinator) {
    i_entranceFee = entranceFee;
    i_interval = interval;
    s_lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;

    i_vrfCoordinator = vrfCoordinator;
}
```

For our imports to work we need to install the Chainlink library, and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink@42c74fcd30969bca26a9aadc07463d1c2f473b8c --no-commit
```

*P.S. I know it doesn't look amazing, bear with me.*

Now run `forge build`. **It will fail**, it should fail because we didn't define a ton of variables. But what matters at this point is how it fails! We need it to fail with the following error:

```
Error: 
Compiler run failed:
Error (7576): Undeclared identifier.
  --> src/Raffle.sol:53:8:
```

If it doesn't fail with that error but fails with this error then we need to do additional things:

```
Error: 
Compiler run failed:
Error (6275): Source "lib/chainlink/contracts/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol" not found: File not found. Searched the following locations:
```

If you got the error above, then `forge` was not able to find out the contracts we imported. Run the following command in your terminal:
```
forge remappings>remappings.txt
```
This will create a new file that contains your project remappings:

```toml
chainlink/=lib/chainlink/contracts/
forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/
```

This is to be read as follows: `chainlink/` in your imports becomes `lib/chainlink/contracts/` behind the stage. We need to make sure that if we apply that change to our import the resulting **PATH is correct**.

 `chainlink/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol` becomes `lib/chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol`, which is correct. Sometimes some elements of the PATH are either missing or doubled, as follows:

 `lib/chainlink/contracts/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol`

 or 

 `lib/chainlink/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol`

Both these variants are **incorrect**. You need to always be able to access the PATH in your explorer window on the left, if you can't then you need to adjust the remappings to match the lib folder structure.

Great, now that we were successfully able to run the imports let's continue fixing the missing variables.

Don't ever be afraid of calling `forge build` even if you know your project won't compile. Our contract lacks some variables that are required inside the `pickWinner` function. Call `forge build`.

Output:
```
Compiler run failed:
Error (7576): Undeclared identifier.

```

At least now we know what's left :smile:

Let's add the above-mentioned variables inside the VRF state variables block:

```solidity
// Chainlink VRF related variables
VRFCoordinatorV2Interface private immutable i_vrfCoordinator;
bytes32 private immutable i_gasLane;
uint64 private immutable i_subscriptionId;
uint16 private constant REQUEST_CONFIRMATIONS = 3;
uint32 private immutable i_callbackGasLimit;
uint32 private constant NUM_WORDS = 1;
```
We have changed the `keyHash` name to `i_gasLane` which is more descriptive for its purpose. Also, we've changed the type of `i_vrfCoordinator`. For our `pickWinner` function to properly call `uint256 requestId = i_vrfCoordinator.requestRandomWords(` we need that `i_vrfCoordinator` to be a contract, specifically the `VRFCoordinatorV2Interface` contract that we've imported.

For simplicity we request only 1 word, thus we make that variable constant. The same goes for request confirmations, this number can vary depending on the blockchain we chose to deploy to but for mainnet 3 is perfect. Cool!

The next step is to attribute values inside the constructor:

```solidity
constructor(uint256 entranceFee, uint256 interval, address vrfCoordinator, bytes32 gasLane, uint64 subscriptionId, uint32 callbackGasLimit) VRFConsumerBaseV2(vrfCoordinator) {
    i_entranceFee = entranceFee;
    i_interval = interval;
    s_lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;

    i_vrfCoordinator = VRFCoordinatorV2Interface(vrfCoordinator);
    i_gasLane = gasLane;
    i_subscriptionId = subscriptionId;
    i_callbackGasLimit = callbackGasLimit;
}
```

Ok, breathe, it's a lot but it's not complicated, let's go through it together:

- First, we need to initiate the VRFConsumerBaseV2 using our constructor `VRFConsumerBaseV2(vrfCoordinator)`;
- We are providing the `gasLane`, `subscriptionId` and `callbackGasLimit` in our input section of the constructor;
- We are assigning the inputted values to the state variables we defined at an earlier point;
- We are casting the `vrfCoordinator` address as `VRFCoordinatorV2Interface` to be able to call it inside the `pickWinner` function.

The last step is to create a new function:

```solidity
function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override {}
```

This will be called by the `vrfCoordinator` when it sends back the requested `randomWords`. This is also where we'll select our winner!

Call the `forge build` again.

```

Perfect! Don't worry. We will use that `requestId` in a future lesson.
