### Recap

I know this lesson was pretty quick, but my intent was to give you some degree of familiarity with the low-level functionality behind interacting with websites in Web3.

If you're interested in expanding your full-stack skills, I encourage you to check out the html-fund-me repo in more depth. Some additional tools and frameworks you may want to investigate include:

- [**React**](https://react.dev/)
- [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev/)

Let's do a refresher on the important things to know under the hood, when it comes to interacting using our wallets.

We learnt, in order to send a transaction, you need to connect your wallet.

The most popular way to connect our wallet to Web3 enabled applications is through browser injection. Our browser can check for the presence of a wallet by checking for the `window.ethereum` object.

Additionally, in order to send a transaction to our wallet, our browser needs an RPC URL or a `provider` this is derived from the `ethereum.window` object that our browser wallet creates.

```js
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
```

Our wallet also provides the browser with an account to use through this line.

```js
const signer = provider.getSigner();
```

Once a wallet is connected, it's important to remember that the browser sends transactions _to_ our wallet for signing/confirmation. The wallet does _not_ provide private key information to the browser application.

We also learnt a basic way to verify the function calls being sent to our wallet through the use of `function selectors` and decoding `calldata`. We'll go over this in more detail later!

That's all there is to this lesson! With your deeper understanding of how transactions are handled, I'll see you in the next one!
