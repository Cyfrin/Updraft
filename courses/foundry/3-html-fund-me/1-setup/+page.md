Hey there! Welcome to Lesson Eight. This session promises to be engaging and insightful as we dive deeper into the world of Development, focusing on MetaMask interactions with websites.

## Maintaining Transparency With Transactions

It is integral to understand how MetaMask, or any wallet for that matter, interacts with a website. Having this foundational knowledge equips you to ensure that your wallet sends the precise transaction you intend it to broadcast.

## HTML FundMe F23: A Raw Javascript Full Website Application

Though we won't be delving into building a full-stack application in this lesson, you can find resources and examples for the same in the full blockchain solidity course on Javascript (JS) with Node JS.

We will, however, discuss HTML FundMe F 23 - a basic raw JavaScript full website application. If you feel crafty, go ahead and replicate it for practical grasp. The objective is to comprehend what happens under the hood when you interact with these websites.

## Diving In Without Prior Introduction

For a fresh change, we'll readily dive into the heart of the course without going through the customary walkthrough. You've been introduced to Git and GitHub in our previous courses, which will come in handy now.

Pull up your code base at Foundry F23, the repository with all our code. Copy the URL and begin working as if you've just downloaded it from GitHub, like this:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

You'll find a 'Quick Start' section in all of my READMEs for your reference. Use it to clone the repository or open the file.

## Spinning Up The Website

The HTML FundMe repository has a very basic HTML and JavaScript structure to run a website. You can use an extension called Live Server to run the website. Alternatively, you should be able to open Reveal in Finder or use your file explorer to open it in your browser.

### Here's how it should look:

```bash
code html-fund-me-f23
```

The website runs on a minimalist architecture, which we're going to use to illustrate how MetaMask interacts with the website.

## Wrapping Up

Having understood the fundamental of interactions between MetaMask and websites, you'd be more confident and aware of your transactions. Your coding journey grows with you. See you at the next lesson!

Keep coding and keep exploring!
