### Intro to Function Selectors

Continuing from the last lesson, when we call the `fund` function our Metamask is going to pop up with a bunch of information about the transaction.

By clicking the `Hex` tab, we can confirm the raw data for this transaction and exactly which function is being called.

We'll go into `function selectors` a lot more later, but the important thing to understand is that when a Solidity contract is compiled, our functions are converted into a low-level bytecode called a `function selector`.

When we call our `fund` function, this is converted to a `function selector` that we can actually verify using Foundry's `cast` command.

```bash
cast sig "fund()"
```

The above should result in the output `0xb60d4288` and when we compare this to the `Hex` data in our Metamask, we see that it does indeed match!

Were the function being called something secret/nefarious like `stealMoney()`. This function selector would be completely different. Running our cast command again confirms this clearly with a return of `0xa7ea5e4e`.

We can use this knowledge to verify any function we're calling through our browser wallet by comparing the expected and actual `function selectors` for the transaction.

There's even a way to decode calldata using the cast command.

Let's say our function was a little different and it required an argument.

```js
function fund(uint256 amount) public payable {
    require(amount.getConversionRate(s_priceFeed) >= MINIMUM_USD, "You need to spend more ETH!");
    // require(PriceConverter.getConversionRate(msg.value) >= MINIMUM_USD, "You need to spend more ETH!");
    s_addressToAmountFunded[msg.sender] += amount;
    s_funders.push(msg.sender);
}
```

If we were to call this function, the information Metamask gives us is a little different.

<img src="/static/html-fundme/3-function-selector/function-selector3.png" style="width: 75%; height: auto;">

In this instance, we can use the command `cast --calldata-decode <SIG> <CALLDATA>` to provide us the parameters being passed in this function call!

```bash
cast --calldata-decode "fund(uint256)" 0xca1d209d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000016345785d8a0000
```

The above decodes to:

```bash
100000000000000000 [1e17]
```

0.1 Eth! The same amount being passed as an argument to our `fund` call. It seems this function is safe!

### Wrap Up

This more or less summarizes how transactions work through our browser wallet and what we can expect to see from a low-level with respect to the encoded `function selectors` and `calldata`, we'll go over those in more detail later.

I encourage you to experiment with the remaining functions on the front end. A few things to try:

- Funding and Withdrawing with an account
- Funding with Account A and Withdrawing with Account B - what happens?
- Verify the `function selectors` of our other functions

In our next lesson we'll recap everything we've learnt so far ðŸ’ª
