## VS Code setup

### Installing VS Code extensions

1. Open the Extensions view:

There are two ways to do this:

Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of VS Code.

Use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+X (Mac).

2. Browse or search for extensions:

The Extensions view displays featured extensions by default.

Use the search bar to find a specific extension by name.

3.  Install the extension:

Once you've found the extension you want, click the "Install" button.
VS Code will handle the download and installation process.

**That's it! The extension should be ready to use within VS Code.**


### Integrating AI into our work

One of the best extensions that integrates AI in our development is GitHub Copilot

Although it's a premium service, its intuitive AI-powered code autocomplete feature could be a game-changer for you. Of course, you can choose to go with other AI extensions based on your preferences.

You can download GitHub Copilot [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot). More details and answers for your GitHub Copilot-related questions are available [here](https://github.com/features/copilot/?editor=vscode#faq).


### Other important VS Code Tips

***Beware the white dot***, if you see it, your work is not saved, which means your project won't behave the way you want it to behave.

```CTRL(CMD) + ` ```opens/closes your terminal. It's the equivalent of pressing the `X` button on the top right part of your terminal. 

The `trash can` button, on the left side of the `X` button destroys the terminal, make sure you always remember the difference between these two buttons.

Hooray! This concludes the setup part of this course. Now we get to the fun part, actually developing a project using solidity and foundry.


### More setup ...

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```
mkdir foundry-f23
cd foundry-f23
```

`mkdir` creates a directory or subdirectory.
`cd` changes the directory.

Moving forward, it's advisable to keep all your repositories in this folder. Thus, you'll always have a place to reference all your code.
