### Adding New Networks Using MetaMask

Conveniently, MetaMask provides an easy way to add EVM-compatible chains. By pre-configuring a host of them, you can add a chain such as the Arbitrum One by simply clicking on the `Networks` button on the top left, then `Add Network` and proceeding to `Add`. The pleasing part is that MetaMask does all the grunt work, filling in all the necessary information for you. A click on Approve Network ensures the successful addition of the network.

Steps:

1. Click on the Networks button on the top left
2. Click on Add Network
3. Choose your desired EVM-compatible chain
4. Click on Add
5. After ensuring all necessary information is already filled in, click on Approve Network

But what can you do if the chain you want to add is not pre-configured?

Simple! You employ the same process we just used to add our new Ganache local chain in the [previous lesson](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry/foundry-simple-storage/deploy-smart-contract-locally)
