### Develop in the cloud using Gitpod

**BIG BOLDED DISCLAIMER: This is not the ideal way to develop smart contracts. While using Gitpod you should never share private information, like a key or a secret phrase. That's if you like to continue being the owner of the associated accounts.**

Gitpod is an online platform that provides cloud-based, pre-configured development environments specifically designed for working with Git repositories. It's similar to Remix IDE, but it allows you to run VS Code in a browser, on a remote server.

Go to [Gitpod's website](https://gitpod.io/login/) and click `Continue with Github`. After that, you'll be able to create a new workspace, starting from a Github repository, using a stable version of VS Code.

You'll be amazed to find out it looks exactly like VS Code. There's also an option to open Gitpod into your VS Code desktop version.

Everything works like in VS Code and thus you should be able to run anything using the same commands.

Gitpod has some [fantastic resources](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/getting-started) to get you started.
