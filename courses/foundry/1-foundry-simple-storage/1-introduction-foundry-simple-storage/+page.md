# Moving Beyond Remix: The Transition to Professional Smart Contract Development

Welcome to this fascinating journey from _Remix_, a phenomenal integrated development environment (IDE), to a more advanced and professional setup. Our goal is to integrate modern toolsets that are widely adopted within the development community. Although the initial transition process might seem daunting, I promise you, it's an enriching learning curve worth experiencing!

## Conquering the Transition: Being Vigilant and Resourceful

We all know that setting up your local development environment without using Remix can be a challenging task. So, I urge you to make the most of these following valuable resources for troubleshooting:

- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Stack Exchange ETH](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- [Web three education dev](https://web3education.dev/)

As we embark on this journey, remember, it's okay for things not to work at the first instance. It's absolutely fine! The trick lies in asking **specific** questions related to the errors you encounter. Install these valuable resources and do not let them be an obstacle in your developmental progression.

We're about to take that plunge and learn how to implement these tools in our development environment right now!

## Introducing Foundry: A Professional Smart Contract Development Framework

Although we're saying goodbye to Remix, we're switching to an even more powerful tool - [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). It's renowned within the developer's community as one of the most popular smart contract development frameworks.

Foundry has numerous pros, such as:

- It's known for its exceptional speed
- It's entirely Solidity-based, eliminating the need to learn other programming languages
- Its documentation is comprehensive.

Cheekily referred to as Brownie or HardHat, Foundry is an invaluable asset to smart contract developers due to its speed and efficiency.

Don't forget to refer to the project's GitHub repo for additional assistance. It contains all the vital code necessary for the course in handy detail.

### Foundry vs. Remix: Why the Transition?

Now, you might wonder, "Why do we need to transition to Foundry when Remix appears to be working just fine?"

Allow me to clarify that. With Remix, we performed many tasks manually, such as compiling or deploying contracts and testing the logic by repeatedly clicking through the UI. If the smart contract contains a large number of functions, the process can quickly escalate, and so can the risk of introducing errors.

On the other hand, Foundry automates these tasks, reducing the risk of errors and improving workflow efficiency. With Foundry, you can run the tests for all the functions via one single command, which is not possible with Remix due to its manual nature.

Foundry also deserves special mention because it is the preferred choice of Smart Contract security engineers and auditors. I'm eager for you to experience the quick and efficient nature of this smart contract development framework.

## Visual Studio Code: A Powerful Text Editor

Next up, I'll introduce you to Visual Studio Code, one of the most robust code editors out there. If you're already comfortable using Visual Studio Code, feel free to skip this part.

Please, don't confuse this with Visual Studio, a separate application - make sure that your selected version is Visual Studio **Code**.

In case you prefer working in an environment like Atom, Sublime, or with tools like PowerShell or Terminal, feel free to do so. However, for this course, we'll stick with Visual Studio Code and you will be guided through its setup.

## Installation Instructions: Find the One that Suits You

Lastly, we'll go through the installation processes for three different systems:

- Mac and Linux
- Windows
- Last-ditch effort: Gitpod installation.

I highly encourage getting everything running natively in your local environment. However, if all else fails, follow the Gitpod installation process.

Stay tuned for the next post where we commence with Mac and Linux installations.

That's all for now, folks. Are you excited to get started on this thrilling journey from Remix to Foundry? Let's forge ahead with a 'learning' and 'growing' mindset!
