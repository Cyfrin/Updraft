Welcome to our step-by-step guide to set up Your Development Environment using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Git. Whether you're new to coding or just trying to set up a fresh machine, this guide will get you up and running in no time.

## Downloading Visual Studio Code

Let's start at the very beginning: by downloading Visual Studio Code. You can download for macOS or, if you're on a Linux system, you'll want the Linux installation. After you have this software installed, you’ll be welcomed by a well-structured interface much as below.

Fortunately, this friendly code editor doesn’t leave you in the dark but gives you tips to get started. By all means, if you're unfamiliar with VSCode, seize the opportunity to navigate through the "Get Started" instructions. These valuable tips could clear many hurdles on your upcoming coding adventures. Additionally, the [Visual Studio Code crash course](https://youtu.be/WPqXP_kLzpo) in the GitHub repository related to this course offers a wealth of concise and handy information.

## Introducing the VSCode Terminal

VSCode offers an immensely helpful feature – the terminal, or command line prompts, providing the backstage entrance to run your scripts. To access it, simply navigate to the 'Terminal' tab in your menu and select 'New Terminal'—you'll be presented with a shell, which could be Bash, ZSH or another type. Regardless of the shell type, they all function pretty similarly.

At this point, a quick note on navigation helps. For Mac or Linux users, the `CTRL + backtick` command allows you to swiftly toggle between Terminal modes, providing a major productivity boost. It's always beneficial to familiarize yourself with keyboard shortcuts as they enable efficient movement around VSCode. To ease your way into shortcut navigation, here you have a comprehensive list of [keyboard shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) for VSCode.

Moreover, terminals can easily be deleted and recreated. Simply hit the trash can icon to delete the terminal, then navigate to `Terminal > New Terminal` to reopen a fresh one.

## Installing Git

As we delve deeper into building your development environment, it's important to introduce Git. While it's not immediately necessary, it’s good practice to install it early on.

If you're on a Linux system, you're likely to use one of two commands to install Git. On a macOS, a simple `git` command in the terminal should prompt an invitation to install.

Once the installation is successful, typing `git version` into the command line should give you something that looks similar to this:

For the macOS folks, there is an easier way by using the macOS Git installer that can be accessed [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) to run through the installation process.

## Wrapping Up

Congrats! You have installed Git and Visual Studio Code. With these basics in place, we'll be able to delve into more detailed coding concepts in the next sections of this guide. Please note that if you're working on a platform not covered, like Windows or Gitpod, you might want to skip the next sections.

Our goal is to ease your journey into the coding world, and we're thrilled to help you establish a strong foundation. Hop onto the next sections and let’s continue this exciting journey.
