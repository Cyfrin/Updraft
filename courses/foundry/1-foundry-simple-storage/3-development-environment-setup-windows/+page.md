Okay, here is a very thorough and detailed summary of the provided video "Installing Windows Dev environment".

**Overall Summary**

The video serves as an introductory guide for setting up a development environment on Microsoft Windows, specifically geared towards courses that might involve tools commonly found in Unix-like systems (like smart contract development). The instructor, Vasili, explains that while Windows has improved, managing development dependencies can be messy. The core recommendation is to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to create a Linux environment within Windows, offering better compatibility and consistency with tools often used in development, especially those originating from the Unix/Linux world. The video then walks through the installation process for WSL and subsequently demonstrates three different methods for installing the popular code editor, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), or its open-source alternative, VSCodium.

**Detailed Breakdown**

1.  **Introduction (0:00 - 0:57)**
    *   **Instructor:** Vasili introduces himself and the purpose of the video: guiding users through setting up a Windows development environment.
    *   **Problem:** Installing developer tools and dependencies directly on Windows can be "tricky" and "messy".
    *   **Solution:** The primary tool to overcome this will be WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
    *   **Instructor's Role:** Vasili mentions he will be the guide for installing, running, and configuring specific tools on Windows throughout related courses.
    *   **Resource Mention:** A separate, 100% free crash course specifically on WSL for smart contract developers is available on YouTube. Users interested in a deeper understanding of WSL (how it works, commands, etc.) should check the link provided in the "written lesson" (implying this video is part of a larger course structure).
    *   **Goal:** Prepare the Windows machine for development tasks covered in subsequent lessons.

2.  **What is WSL? (0:58 - 2:05)**
    *   **Microsoft's Progress:** Acknowledges that Microsoft has improved Windows for developers (better library support, improved Powershell, Winget installer).
    *   **Why WSL is Better (Especially for Smart Contracts/Unix Tools):**
        *   Smart contract development often uses tools/utilities common in Unix-based environments (Linux, macOS).
        *   While Windows has improved, challenges can still arise with certain command-line tools and environment setups.
        *   Using a Unix-based system enhances code portability, making it easier to ensure code runs correctly on different machines (Mac, Linux servers, etc.).
        *   WSL acts as a "game changer" by providing access to a full-fledged, Unix-like Linux console directly within the Windows machine.
    *   **Ease of Use:** Emphasizes that installing and using WSL is straightforward and not overly technical ("you don't need to be a hacker").

3.  **Installing WSL (2:06 - 4:36)**
    *   **Prerequisite:** Windows Terminal.
        *   **Windows 11:** Pre-installed. Open by pressing the Windows key, typing "Terminal", and pressing Enter. It defaults to Windows PowerShell.
        *   **Windows 10:** May need to be installed first from the Microsoft Store. *Tip:* Search for "Windows Terminal" in the Store and ensure you select the one published by "Microsoft Corporation".
    *   **Installation Command:**
        *   Open Windows Terminal (as PowerShell or Command Prompt).
        *   Run the command:
            ```powershell
            wsl --install
            ```
        *   *Note:* This command requires administrator privileges and will trigger a User Account Control (UAC) prompt. The user must select "Yes".
    *   **Restart Required:** The `wsl --install` command necessitates a system restart upon completion.
    *   **Post-Restart Setup:**
        *   After rebooting, WSL installation automatically continues, typically opening a terminal window for the default Linux distribution (Ubuntu is shown and mentioned as the default).
        *   **Create UNIX User:** The user is prompted to create a username for the Linux environment. This username does *not* need to match the Windows username. (Instructor uses `cromewar`).
        *   **Create UNIX Password:** The user is prompted to set a password for the new Linux user.
        *   *Important Tip:* When typing the password in this Linux terminal, characters are *not* displayed (it remains hidden for security). This is normal behavior for most Linux terminals.
        *   The user is prompted to retype the password for confirmation.
    *   **Completion:** Once the username and password are set, a confirmation message ("Installation successful!") appears, and the user is dropped into the Linux (Ubuntu) shell prompt, indicating WSL is ready.

4.  **Installing the Code Editor (VS Code / VSCodium) (4:37 - 8:59)**
    *   **Context:** A code editor is needed for development. VS Code is the focus.
    *   **Three Installation Methods Shown:**
        1.  **Using Winget (Terminal Package Manager):**
            *   Described as the "hacker/programmer way".
            *   `winget` is pre-installed on Windows 11. For Windows 10, it can be installed separately (link mentioned to be in the "Course Repo").
            *   **Command to Search:**
                ```powershell
                winget search vscode
                ```
                (This finds available packages related to VS Code).
            *   **Command to Install:** (Using the ID found from the search)
                ```powershell
                winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
                ```
            *   Winget handles the download and installation automatically.
        2.  **Using the Official Website Download:**
            *   Open a web browser.
            *   Search for "visual studio code".
            *   *Important Link:* Navigate to the official site: `code.visualstudio.com`.
            *   Click the "Download for Windows" button.
            *   Save the `.exe` installer file.
            *   Run the downloaded `.exe` file.
            *   Follow the graphical installer prompts:
                *   Accept the License Agreement. (*Tip: Good practice to actually read these agreements*).
                *   Choose the install location (default is usually fine).
                *   Select Additional Tasks:
                    *   *Tip:* Instructor strongly recommends enabling "Add 'Open with Code' action to Windows Explorer file context menu" and "...directory context menu". This allows right-clicking files/folders in Windows Explorer to open them directly in VS Code.
                    *   Instructor also selects "Create a desktop icon".
                    *   "Add to PATH" is crucial and usually checked by default.
                *   Click "Install".
        3.  **Using VSCodium (Open Source Alternative):**
            *   **Reason:** For users concerned about Microsoft's telemetry (data collection) within the standard VS Code.
            *   **What it is:** VSCodium is a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of VS Code's source code *with* Microsoft's telemetry, branding, and specific licensing removed. It uses the permissive MIT license.
            *   *Important Link:* `vscodium.com`.
            *   Navigate to the "Install" section or "Download latest release" (often links to GitHub releases).
            *   Download the appropriate `.exe` installer for Windows (e.g., `VSCodiumUserSetup-x64-...exe`).
            *   Run the downloaded `.exe`.
            *   *Important Note:* Windows Defender SmartScreen may block the execution because the publisher is unknown/not Microsoft. Click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed.
            *   The installation process is graphically similar to the standard VS Code installer.
    *   **Instructor's Choice:** Vasili states that for the remainder of the course/tutorials, he will be using the standard Visual Studio Code downloaded from Microsoft.

**Key Concepts**

*   **Windows Development Environment:** The set of tools and configurations needed to write, run, and test code on a Windows machine.
*   **Dependency Management:** The process of handling external libraries or software required by a project. Can be complex on Windows compared to Linux.
*   **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):** A compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows. It provides a Linux kernel interface and allows installing Linux distributions (like Ubuntu). Crucial for accessing a Unix-like environment without dual-booting or virtual machines.
*   **Unix-like Environment:** An operating system environment that behaves similarly to the Unix system, characterized by tools like `bash`, `grep`, `sed`, standard file system structures, etc. macOS and Linux are primary examples.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI) / Terminal:** Text-based interface for interacting with the operating system (e.g., Windows Terminal, PowerShell, Bash).
*   **Code Editor:** Software used for writing and editing source code (e.g., VS Code, VSCodium).
*   **Package Manager:** A tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages (e.g., `winget` for Windows, `apt` for Ubuntu/Debian).
*   **Telemetry:** Data collected automatically by software about its usage and performance, often sent back to the developer (Microsoft in VS Code's case). VSCodium removes this.
*   **Open Source:** Software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. VSCodium is built from VS Code's open-source code.
*   **Software Licensing:** Legal terms governing the use and distribution of software (e.g., Microsoft's license for VS Code, MIT license for VSCodium).

**Important Code Blocks/Commands**

*   `wsl --install`: Used in PowerShell/CMD to install WSL and its default Linux distribution (Ubuntu). Requires admin rights and a reboot.
*   `winget search <package_name>`: Used to find available software packages via the Winget package manager (e.g., `winget search vscode`).
*   `winget install <package_id>`: Used to install software via Winget (e.g., `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode`).

**Important Links/Resources Mentioned**

*   **WSL Crash Course:** A separate free YouTube course by the instructor (link to be found in the "written lesson").
*   **Windows Terminal (Microsoft Store):** For Windows 10 users needing to install it.
*   **Winget Documentation/Installer:** For Windows 10 users needing `winget` (link to be found in the "Course Repo").
*   **Visual Studio Code Official Website:** `code.visualstudio.com` (for downloading the standard installer).
*   **VSCodium Official Website:** `vscodium.com` (for information and download links for the telemetry-free version).
*   **VSCodium GitHub Releases:** Where the VSCodium installers are hosted.

**Important Notes & Tips**

*   Installing dependencies on Windows can be messy; WSL is the recommended solution for consistency.
*   When installing Windows Terminal on Win 10, ensure it's the official one from Microsoft Corporation in the Store.
*   The `wsl --install` command requires a system restart.
*   Passwords typed into the Linux terminal (during WSL setup) are hidden by default.
*   When installing VS Code manually, enabling the "Open with Code" context menu options is highly recommended for convenience.
*   VSCodium is a viable alternative if Microsoft's telemetry in VS Code is a concern.
*   Windows SmartScreen might block VSCodium's installer; use "More info" -> "Run anyway" to bypass.
