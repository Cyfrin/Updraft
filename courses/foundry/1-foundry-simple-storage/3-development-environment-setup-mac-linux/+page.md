### Development environment setup (Mac, Linux)

Windows users please go to the [next lesson](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry/foundry-simple-storage/development-environment-setup-windows).

Mac and Linux users download VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The setup is straightforward.
If this is your first time using VS Code spend some time and navigate through the "Get Started with VS Code" instructions. These valuable tips could clear many hurdles in your upcoming coding adventures. Moreover, to get an even better grasp on using VS Code, consider going through the [Visual Studio Code Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPqXP_kLzpo) from freeCodeCamp.

### VS Code terminal

VS Code has a built-in terminal emulator, often simply referred to as the VS Code terminal. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) environment directly within VS Code, allowing you to interact with your operating system and run various tools and utilities.

You can open up multiple terminals at the same time running different shells ranging from bash, Powershell, WSL and many more depending on what you have configured.

Use the `+` button to create a new terminal or the trash button to kill the current terminal.

Whether you are learning **Foundry** for development work or security work, moving fast is one of the keys to efficiency. VS Code is very versatile in terms of keyboard shortcuts, you can learn more [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).

### Git installation

Whether you have it and it needs to be updated or you need to perform a fresh install the best way to approach this is by visiting the [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and following the instructions there.
