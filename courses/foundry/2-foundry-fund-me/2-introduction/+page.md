Welcome to the Fund Me section of this Foundry course! To get started, you can visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu) associated with this section. By the end of this course, you'll be able to push your first codebase to Github 🎉.

> 💡 **TIP**:br
> Being active on a version control system like Github or [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) is essential for participating in the web3 ecosystem 👥.

In this section, we'll refer to the `FundMe` contract we built in the previous section. Additionally, we will explore storage using the [`FunWithStorage`](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu/blob/main/src/exampleContracts/FunWithStorage.sol) contract and interact with it using `cast`.

We'll also learn professional deployment techniques on different chains with Foundry **[scripts](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu/blob/main/script/DeployFundMe.s.sol)**. They will enable us to interact with contracts through **reproducible actions** instead of typing commands manually each time.

Furthermore, we'll cover making contracts more gas-efficient, some debugging techniques, and setting up a professional development environment.
Lastly, we'll implement a lot of **tests** to ensure the reliability and security of our smart contracts.
