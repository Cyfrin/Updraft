### Recap

This was a monumental section! And you are a true hero for completing it!

Let's quickly go through what we learned in this one:

- We learned more about how to set up a Foundry project
- We learned how to organize our files into folders, following the convention
- We learned how to refactor smart contracts to make them modular and chain-agnostic
- We learned how to write scripts that act as interaction commands
- We learned more about using mocks
- We did a bunch of unit tests, we even did an integration test
- We learned a bit about Makefiles
- We learned how to create a GitHub repository and push our code in it
- We also learned how to clone a GitHub repository

This was a lot and you deserve a break! Take a walk, play a game and come back for more!

See you in the next section!
