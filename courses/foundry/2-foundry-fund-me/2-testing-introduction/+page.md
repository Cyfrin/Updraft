To stand out from the crowd, one must not only master the development of smart contracts but also proficiency in testing these smart contracts. This not only guarantees you the quality and reliability of your code but also significantly reduces the occurrence of runtime issues that could potentially cost both clients and organization substantial amounts.

In this blog post, we will take a deep dive into the fascinating world of testing smart contracts, basing our illustrations on `forge test` command and the `counter.t.sol` example file.

Start today by adopting test-driven development in your programming regimen. It might seem tedious to begin with, but once you comprehend its value, you will appreciate the increased reliability and robustness it rings to your code.

Don't forget, always run `forge test` to check the health of your smart contract before shipping out your code. Stay tuned for a more detailed exploration of testing and foundry fundamentals in the next lesson.
