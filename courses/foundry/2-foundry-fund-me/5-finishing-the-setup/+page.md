### Finishing the setup

Please delete the `Counter` files that Foundry prepopulated in our new project.

In `src` create two files, `FundMe.sol` and `PriceConverter.sol`.

Go on the [Remix Fund Me repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-fund-me-f23) and copy the contents of both contracts.

Try running `forge compile` or `forge build`. A few errors will pop up. What's the problem?

If you open both the copied smart contracts you will see that up top we `import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";`. This wasn't a problem in Remix because Remix automatically takes care of this problem for you. In Foundry you have to manually install all your dependencies.

`forge install` is the command we are using to install one or multiple dependencies. [Go here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cli/forge/install?highlight=install#forge-install) to read more about this command.

Call the following:

```
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
```

Wait for it to finish.

We used `forge install` to ask Forge to install something in our project. What? We specified the path to a GitHub repository, this also could have been a raw URL. What version? Following the path to a GitHub repository you can add an `@` and then you can specify:

- A branch: master
- A tag: v1.2.3.4 or 0.6.1 in our case
- A commit: 8e8128

We end the install command with `--no commit` in order to not create a git commit. More on this option later.

If we open the `lib` folder, we can see the `forge-std` which is installed automatically within the `forge init` setup and `chainlink-brownie-contracts` which we just installed. Look through the former, you'll see a folder called `contracts` then a folder called `src`. Here you can find different versions, and inside them, you can find a plethora of contracts, some of which we are going to use in this course. Here we can find the `AggregatorV3Interface` that we are importing in `FundMe.sol`. 

But if you open the `FundMe.sol` you'll see that we are importing `{AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";` not from  `/foundry-fund-me-f23/lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol`. How does Foundry know `@chainlink` to half of the path?

Open `foundry.toml`. Below the last line of `[profile.default]` paste the following:

```toml
remappings = ['@chainlink/contracts/=lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/']
```

Now Forge knows to equivalate these. Let's try to compile now by calling `forge compile` or `forge build`.

**Awesome! Everything complies.**

Fixing dependencies in projects is one of the most undesirable things in smart contracts development/audit. Take it slow, make sure you select the proper GitHub repository path, make sure your remappings are solid and they match your imports and everything will be fine!
