### Analyzing the Counter contracts

Continuing from the previous lesson, the `forge init` populated our project with the `Counter` files.

#### Counter.sol

It's a simple smart contract that stores a number. You have a function to `setNumber` where you specify a `newNumber` which is a `uint256`, and store it, and you have a function to `increment` the number.

**Note:** `number++` is equivalent to `number = number + 1`.

#### Counter.s.sol

Just a placeholder, it doesn't do anything

#### Counter.t.sol

This is the interesting part. We haven't talked that much about carrying tests using Foundry. This is an essential step for any project. The `test` folder will become our new home throughout this course.

Please run the following command in your terminal:

```
forge test
```

After the contracts are compiled you will see an output related to tests:
- How many tests were found;
- In which file;
- Did they pass or not?;
- Summary;

### How does `forge test` work?

`forge test` has a lot of options that allow you to configure what is tested, how the results are displayed, where is the test conducted and many more!

Run `forge test --help` to explore the options. I suggest reading [this page](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests) and navigating deeper into the Foundry Book to discover how tests work.

But in short, in our specific case:

1. Forge identified all the files in the test folder, went into the only file available and ran the `setUp` function.
2. After the setup is performed it goes from top to bottom in search of public/external functions that start with `test`.
3. All of them will be called and the conclusion of their execution will be displayed. By that we mean it will run all the `assert` statements it can find and if all evaluate to `true` then the test will pass. If one of the `assert` statements evaluates to `false` the test will fail.
