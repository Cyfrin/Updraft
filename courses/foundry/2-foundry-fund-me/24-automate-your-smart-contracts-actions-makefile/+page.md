### The magic of Makefile

You are a hero for getting this far! If you think a bit about your experience with the whole `FundMe` project by now, how many times have you written a `forge script NameOfScript --rpc-url xyz --private-key 0xPrivateKey ...`. There's got to be an easier way to run scripts and other commands. 

The answer for all your troubles is a `Makefile`!

A `Makefile` is a special file used in conjunction with the `make` command in Unix-based systems and some other environments. It provides instructions for automating the process of building software projects.

The main advantages of using a `Makefile` are:

- Automates tasks related to building and deploying your smart contracts.
- Integrates with Foundry commands like `forge build`, `forge test` and `forge script`.
- Can manage dependencies between different smart contract files.
- Streamlines the development workflow by reducing repetitive manual commands.
- Allows you to automatically grab the `.env` contents.

In the root folder of your project create a new file called `Makefile`.

After creating the file run `make` in your terminal.

If you have `make` installed then you should receive the following message:

`make: *** No targets.  Stop`

If you don't get this message you need to install `make`. This is a perfect time to ask your favorite AI to help, but if you still don't manage it please come on the Updraft section of Cyfrin discord and ask the lovely people there.

Let's start our `Makefile` with `-include .env` on the first line. This way we don't have to call `source .env` every time we want to access something from it.

Soo... how do we actually write a shortcut?

Let's write one for `forge build`.

In your `Makefile` write the following line:

`build:; forge build`

Run `make build` in your terminal.

```
make build
forge build
[â ”] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
```

And it works! We've written our first shortcut. Arguably not the best of shortcuts, we've saved 1 letter, but still, it's a start. 

**Small note**: The `:;` between `build` and `forge build` is used to indicate that the command will be given on the same line. Change the `build` shortcut as follows:

```
build:
	forge build
```

Run it again.

Let's write a more complex shortcut. Add the following shortcut to your `Makefile`:

```
deploy-sepolia:
	forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol:DeployFundMe --rpc-url $(SEPOLIA_RPC_URL) --private-key $(SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY) --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $(ETHERSCAN_API_KEY) -vvvv
```

Now this is a mouthful. But you already know what we did above, we used `forge script` to deploy `fundMe` on Sepolia, using the private key and rpc-url we provided in the `.env`, we used `--broadcast` for the transaction to be broadcasted, and then we `verify` the contract on etherscan. The only difference compared to what we did before is encapsulating `.env` variables between round brackets. This is how Makefile knows these come from the `.env`.

The `--verify` option `verifies all the contracts found in the receipts of a script, if any`. We could use the `--verifier` option to select another verifier, but we don't need that because the default option is `etherscan`. So the only thing we need is an etherscan API key. To get one go to [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/register) and make an account. After that, log in, go to `OTHERS > API Keys` add a new project and copy the API Key Token.

Open your `.env` file and add the following line:

`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=THEAPIKEYYOUCOPIEDFROMETHERSCANGOESHERE`

Make sure your `.env` holds all the things it needs to run the shortcut above. Again, we do not use private keys associated with accounts that hold real money. Stay safe!

The moment of truth:

`make deploy-sepolia`

```

Contract verification status:

All (1) contracts were verified!
```

The contract is deployed on Sepolia and we verified it on [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x2bc3f6eb5c38532f70dd59ac6a0610453bc16e9f).

Amazing work!

This is just an introductory lesson on how to write Makefiles. Properly organizing your scripts and then transforming them into shortcuts that save you from typing 3 lines of code in the terminal is an ART!

Let's pass through some examples. Go copy the [Makefile available in the Fund Me repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-f23/blob/main/Makefile). 

Treat this `Makefile` as a framework for your projects.

Open the file and go through it.

The `.PHONY:` tells make that all the `all test clean deploy fund help install snapshot format anvil` are not folders. Following that we declare the `DEFAULT_ANVIL_KEY` and a custom help message.

Run make help to print it in your terminal.

There are a lot of useful shortcuts related to dependencies, formatting, deployment etc.

For example, run the following commands:

`make anvil`

Open a new terminal.

`make deploy`

And you just deployed a fresh `FundMe` contract on a fresh `anvil` blockchain. Super fast and super cool!

We could do the same for Sepolia by running `make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"`.

Makefile is amazing!
