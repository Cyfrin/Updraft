## Challenge: Deploy Your First Site with Fleek

Alright, congratulations on making it this far! Be proud of the progress you've made. We're now moving into a crucial, hands-on phase with a challenge designed to solidify your learning and give you a tangible result.

This next challenge is incredibly important, especially if you haven't been coding along exactly with every step prior.

**Challenge #2: Deploy Your Site to Fleek!**

Your core task is to deploy a website using the Fleek platform. Here’s the key point: you **do not** need to deploy the specific `t-sender` application if you haven't built it or don't have it ready. The goal is to gain experience with the deployment process itself. Deploy *something* – any simple website project you have will work.

You have two primary methods to accomplish this:

1.  **Fleek CLI:** Use the Command Line Interface provided by Fleek.
2.  **Fleek Website:** Use the user-friendly web interface on the Fleek site.

Successfully completing this step will deploy your site's files to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and provide you with a publicly accessible URL. Getting your first site live is a significant milestone!

**Challenge #2.i: Tweet It Out!**

Once your deployment is successful and you have your public URL, it's time to share your achievement.

1.  Locate the "Tweet it out!" link within the course materials (likely on the associated GitHub page).
2.  Clicking this link will open a new Twitter (X.com) post window with pre-filled text.
3.  The pre-filled text will look like this:
    ```
    I just deployed a nextjs site using @fleek that can connect to @zksyncdevs!

    Thanks @PatrickAlphaC and @cyfrinupdraft!
    ```
    *(Note: Even if your deployed site isn't using Next.js or connecting to zkSync, sharing this helps connect with the course community and technologies.)*
4.  Hit the "Post" button to share your success.

**Why This Challenge Matters**

Completing these challenges, especially this deployment task, is incredibly beneficial for several reasons:

*   **Confidence Boost:** Successfully deploying your very first website is a massive confidence builder. It turns abstract concepts into concrete reality.
*   **Portfolio Value:** Having a live, deployed project (even a simple one) is a valuable addition to your developer portfolio. It demonstrates practical skills.
*   **Community Engagement:** Tweeting your success connects you with the broader developer community. It lets instructors (@PatrickAlphaC, @cyfrinupdraft) and relevant technology teams (@fleek, @zksyncdevs) see your progress. These teams genuinely love seeing developers building and thriving in the ecosystem. You might even make some new connections along the way.
*   **Celebrate Your Wins:** Learning to code and navigating web3 involves many steps. It's important to acknowledge and celebrate milestones like deploying your first site.

So, take this step seriously. Don't just watch or read about it – *actually deploy* a site to Fleek, and *actually tweet* about it using the provided link.

Pause here, complete the deployment and the tweet, and then continue with the next part of the course. We'll see you soon!
