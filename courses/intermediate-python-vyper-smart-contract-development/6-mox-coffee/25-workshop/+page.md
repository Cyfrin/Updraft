## Introduction to Testing in Solidity

In this lesson, we will cover some best practices for testing your Solidity code, in this case, we will focus on our `buy_me_a_coffee` contract.
 
We've already learned a lot, now we will get hands-on with our testing methods. We'll begin by writing enough tests to get our code to 100% coverage. 

Here is how we'll do it:

1.  Write enough tests to get your code to 100% code coverage for `buy_me_a_coffee.vy`.

    We'll be using our testing framework:

    ```bash
    mox test --coverage
    ```

    We'll use this command to run our tests, which will output the coverage we have achieved. 

2. Sign up for [Cyfrn Profiles](https://profiles.cyfrn.io/). 

     This is very important for building your web3 career. Cyfrn Profiles provides a platform for you to showcase your skills, find opportunities, and build a network of fellow developers.

3. Push your code to GitHub

    By pushing your code to GitHub, you'll be able to share your progress with others, document your work, and track changes.

4.  Add a new commit to your GitHub repo

    Adding a commit helps to keep your project organized and track the changes you make. 

We encourage you to spend at most 25 minutes on this workshop, without the aid of AI. If you're unable to solve it, take a break, and then work with AI or look to the discussions for help. Good luck!
