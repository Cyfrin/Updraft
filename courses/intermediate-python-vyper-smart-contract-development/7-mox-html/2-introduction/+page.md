## HTML/JS Fund Me (Quick Fullstack/Front End Tutorial)

In this lesson, we will take a look at HTML/JS Fund Me (Quick Fullstack/Front End Tutorial).

We can find the code for this lesson on our GitHub repo:

```python
Cyfriin/foundry-full-course-f23
```

In this lesson we will be learning the basics of how our MetaMask or wallet interacts with a website. This is important knowledge. We will also be teaching you how to verify that your wallet is sending the transaction that you intended to send.

We will not be teaching you how to build a full-stack application in this lesson. However, we are planning to launch a full-stack course on Cyfriin Updraft in the future.

This HTML/JS Fund Me is a very basic, raw JavaScript full-website application. If you want to try to replicate it, you are free to do so. However, it is important that you understand what is going on under the hood when you interact with these websites. The knowledge that we are going to teach you here will work for every single website you interact with. This will allow you to know exactly what's going on when you interact with a website and send a transaction to the blockchain.

Normally, we walk you through what we're going to do, but in this lesson we will jump right in.

Assuming that you have downloaded Git, and have been working with Git and GitHub, we can actually start working with this codebase as if we had just come across it.
