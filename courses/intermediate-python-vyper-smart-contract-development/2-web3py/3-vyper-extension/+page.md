## Vyper VS Code Extension

We'll go back to the GitHub repo for this course: [link to repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/web3py-favorites-cu) and then we can either grab the `favorites.vy` file from the Web3py Favorite's Cyfrin Updraft, or go back to the Moccasin full course.

We'll scroll up and look for the Favorite's Cyfrin Updraft repo. We'll click the `favorites.vy` file and then copy the entire file.

Next, we'll go to our VS Code and right-click in the file explorer. We'll create a new file and name it `favorites.vy`, and then paste the copied code into it.

We'll now have our smart contract in our code editor. It's likely to look pretty rough and lack syntax highlighting.

Remember that Remix has really nice syntax highlighting. We can get the same functionality in VS Code by using an extension. We'll go to the Extensions tab in VS Code and search for "Vyper". We'll see the "Vyper" extension by TintinWeb. We'll install it.

We'll now see that our Vyper file is highlighted very nicely.

**Tip:** If you have Vyper installed, you can type `which Vyper` in your terminal. This should show you the version you have installed.

You might also see some red squiggly lines, this could be an indication that you have the wrong version of Vyper installed. But, if you've been following along in the previous sections, then you should have the right version.

We'll cover how to fix this in a later section, but for now, we're going to keep moving forward.
