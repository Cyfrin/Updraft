## Development Environment Setup Introduction

In this lesson, we'll be looking at installing Visual Studio Code. We'll go through three different installation methods, for MacOS/Linux, Windows, and Gitpod/Codespaces. However, we recommend against using Gitpod or Codespaces because you can quickly run out of your free trial on those platforms.

Visual Studio Code is often referred to as VS Code. It's a great tool for us to use in this course, as it'll make our development experience a lot easier. We'll also discuss the benefits of using Visual Studio Code and how to avoid common pitfalls. We'll be using an AI to help us debug any issues that we run into during this course.

Let's start with Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a standalone source code editor that runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The top pick for JavaScript and web developers, it works with extensions to support just about any programming language.

For MacOS and Linux, we're going to download and install the Visual Studio Code application. The process is very straightforward. We'll use the download link provided on their website, [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

For Windows, we'll download and install the Visual Studio Code application using a different method. The process is similar to installing it on MacOS and Linux. We'll again use the download link provided on their website, [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

In the next few sections, we'll go through setting up Visual Studio Code the way we like it, but, of course, you can set it up however you like.
