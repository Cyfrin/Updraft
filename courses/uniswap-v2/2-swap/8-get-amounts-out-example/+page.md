We're going to step through the `getAmountsOut` function in the Uniswap V2 library contract, step by step. This function helps us calculate the amount of tokens we'll receive after a series of swaps along a specified path. 

Let's start with an example. We'll input 1 WETH and specify a path that goes through DAI and then to MKR.  

The `getAmountsOut` function takes three inputs:

* `amountIn`: The amount of the initial token we're starting with. 
* `path`: The list of tokens involved in the swap. In our example, this is `[WETH, DAI, MKR]`.
* `factory`: The Uniswap factory contract. This contract is used to create and manage the liquidity pools for the different tokens on Uniswap.

The first step is to initialize a `uint` array called `amounts` with the length of the path, which in this case is 3. The first element of this array will be set to our input amount, which is `1e18` (representing 1 WETH).

```javascript
amounts = new uint[](path.length);
amounts[0] = amountIn;
```

Next, we'll use a for loop to iterate through the path and calculate the output amounts for each swap.  

The loop will start at index 0 and continue until it reaches the end of the path. For each iteration, the loop will:

1. Determine the current pair contract by accessing `path[i]` and `path[i + 1]`. This pair contract represents the pool where we'll be swapping our current token. 
2. Get the reserve balances for the two tokens in the pair contract. The `getReserves` function on the factory contract returns these reserve balances. 
3. Calculate the amount of tokens we'll receive in the swap. This calculation is done using the `getAmountOut` function on the pair contract. 
4. Store the calculated output amount in the `amounts` array at the `i + 1` index. 

```javascript
for (uint i = 0; i < path.length - 1; i++) {
  (uint reserveIn, uint reserveOut) = getReserves(factory, path[i], path[i + 1]);
  amounts[i + 1] = getAmountOut(amounts[i], reserveIn, reserveOut);
}
```

The output of this function is the `amounts` array, which contains the calculated output amounts for each step in the swap path. In our example, the `amounts` array will end up containing the following values:

* `amounts[0]`: 1e18 (1 WETH)
* `amounts[1]`: 2,500.3397 * 1e18 (amount of DAI received after swapping 1 WETH)
* `amounts[2]`: 1.2427 * 1e18 (amount of MKR received after swapping the DAI)

The `getAmountsOut` function plays a crucial role in Uniswap V2, enabling users to calculate the potential outcomes of swaps and make informed trading decisions.
