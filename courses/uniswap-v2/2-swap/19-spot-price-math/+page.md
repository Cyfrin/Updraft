## Spot Price (Mid Price)

We are going to talk about the spot price. This is also called the *mid price*, and it is a way of determining the price of one token in terms of another token in an AMM. 

We can use a simple equation to calculate the spot price:

```
y0 / x0
```

*y0* is the amount of token Y in the AMM.
*x0* is the amount of token X in the AMM.

If we want to know the spot price of token Y in terms of token X, we just flip the equation:

```
x0 / y0
```

Let's look at an example. Let's say token X is ETH, and there are 3,000 ETH in the AMM. Let's also say token Y is DAI, and there are 6 million DAI in the AMM. 

The spot price of ETH in terms of DAI is then:

```
6,000,000 / 3,000 = 2,000 DAI / ETH
```

In the next video, we'll show how to derive the equation we just used. We'll do that by looking at a small trade.
