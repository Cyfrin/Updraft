## Uniswap V2

We're excited to get started with our course on Uniswap V2! This course will provide you with a deep understanding of this popular decentralized exchange protocol, empowering you to build and interact with DeFi applications.

### Who is this course for?

This course is designed for Solidity developers who have some experience with the language and are eager to delve into the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). We'll be working with Foundry, so familiarity with this testing framework is assumed. A basic understanding of high school math will also be helpful for grasping some of the concepts we'll be exploring.

### Why should you take this course?

Uniswap V2 is a foundational protocol in DeFi, serving as the basis for countless other AMMs (Automated Market Makers). Understanding how it functions under the hood will provide you with a valuable foundation for working with other DeFi protocols and projects.  Furthermore, this knowledge will prove particularly useful if you're interested in participating in audit contests or bug bounty programs that involve Uniswap V2. 

### What will you learn?

This course will cover:

* The mathematical principles behind constant product AMMs.
*  A thorough examination of Uniswap V2 contracts.
* Testing with Foundry on a mainnet fork.  This will provide you with hands-on experience simulating real-world transactions, allowing you to interact with the Uniswap V2 contracts in a safe and cost-effective environment.

### Best Practices for Learning Effectively

To maximize your learning experience, we recommend following these best practices:

* **Learn by doing**.  Don't just passively watch the videos - get your hands dirty!  Try running code examples and experimenting with Foundry to solidify your understanding.
* **Play around with Foundry and a mainnet fork**.  Don't be afraid to experiment! This is a great way to get comfortable with the protocol and understand how it functions in a real-world scenario.
* **Take notes, and make them easy to find.**  We recommend pushing your notes to a GitHub repository for easy access and referencing. 
* **No need to memorize.**  Focus on understanding the concepts and how they fit together rather than trying to memorize specific equations or function names. The information you need will stick to you through practice and experimentation. 

We're confident that this course will provide you with a strong foundation in Uniswap V2 and equip you with the skills you need to navigate the dynamic world of DeFi.  Let's get started!
