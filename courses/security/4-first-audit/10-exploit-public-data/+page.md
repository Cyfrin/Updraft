Alright, one function down, one to go. Let's take a look at what's next.

```js
/*
* @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
* @param newPassword The new password to set.
*/
function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {
    if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
    }
    return s_password;
}
```

Starting, starting as always with the `NatSpec` documentation, we see a couple things to note:

- Only the owner should be able to retrieve the password (_your `access control` bells should be ringing_)
- The function should take the parameter `newPassword`.

We see a problem on the very next line. This function _doesn't take_ a parameter. Certainly informational, but let's make a note of it.

```js
/*
* @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
// @Audit - parameter not used by function, NatSpec can be removed
* @param newPassword The new password to set.
*/
```

Let's take a look at the function itself.

The function looks great! Adhering to the required access control, we can be sure only the owner can call this function.

So we're done, right? Web3 is secure! ðŸ¥³

...

Well, not exactly. There's another issue hidden in this contract and I want you to take a moment before continuing to try to find it.

I'll give you a hint: `State Variables`.

We've uncovered a major flaw in the business logic of this protocol. It's best we make a note of this.

```js
address private s_owner;
// @Audit - s_password variable is not actually private! Everything on the blockchain is public, this is not a safe place to store your password.
string private s_password;
```

### Wrap up

If you're unsure how it's possible for someone to read this data, don't worry - we'll be writing a proof of code to show how it's done. This is something covered in our [**Foundry Course**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/advanced-foundry) however, consider a refresher if this is entirely new to you as we'll be building on these concepts later on.
