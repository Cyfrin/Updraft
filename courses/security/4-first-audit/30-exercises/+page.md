### Congratulations!

I sincerely want to congratulate you on making it through your first audit experience. It's a giant leap forward in your journey to beefing up your security skills.

This codebase was obviously very small, with fairly obvious bugs, the difficulty is going to ramp up from here. Don't worry if you had a hard time spotting these vulnerabilities. So much of successful auditing comes with practice and familiarity.

By the end of this course, your portfolio will contain not one, but six impressively professional security reviews! The 'Final Boss' audit `Vault Guardians` is going to really test our skills. SO EXCITING.

Before we conclude section 3, there are 2 exercises I have for you to complete.

1. **Tweet about your progress**: Publicly acknowledging and sharing your small wins often gives a big motivational boost. Tweet about your experience so far, and don't forget to join the community discussions on platforms like [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/cyfrin) and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23/discussions).
2. **Sign up for Code Hawks**: Now comes the practical application of what you have learned so far. After completing this task, you will be ready to start performing "competitive audits". Although there are a few more skills for you to learn, you're overwhelmingly ready for this challenge! So, sign up [**here**](https://www.codehawks.com/).

### Take a Break

Now is a perfect time to take a break (ice cream). Our next security review is a big one. Relax and bask in your accomplishments! Well done!
