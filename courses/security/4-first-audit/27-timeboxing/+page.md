### Are we done?

Now, we've done a lot. You're probably wondering if we should go back and look at the code again. Maybe we missed something...

Take a moment to consider what you would do in a `live audit` situation. Consider your answer before continuing on.

Maybe.

Honestly, we can always look at one more line of code. We can always further scrutinize a repo. At some point however, we have to say "I'm done."

A lot of time's we're going to be time-boxed in what we do. There will be a limit to the amount of time we can reasonably spend on something. Sometimes this time-boxing is a hard limit we impose on ourselves to assure we remain at our most efficient.

Often a pressing situation comes down to time management and setting bounds on the time we spend on things.

We'll go over a few time-boxing strategies a little later as well.
