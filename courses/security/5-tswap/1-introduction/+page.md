# Unveiling Invariance and DeFi in Security Auditing: An Interactive Exploration

Happy to have you back in the exciting world of Security and Auditing. So, you’ve made it through the delightful puppy raffle, you have ideally signed up for CodeHawks and might have sprung into your first few flights or even explored a contest. That's awesome! You'd certainly be exuding more confidence about your security and auditing journey. But there's a lot more to unfold and absorb.

## Entering Section Five: Invariance and Introduction to DFI T-SWAP Audit

In our detailed Git repo related to this course, when you scroll down, Section Five, Invariance and Introduction to DFI TSWAP Audit, will catch your attention. Making your journey a slight bit more interesting this time, we are moving onto another walkthrough security review. This time around, we will approach the task differently.

## A Glimpse of What’s to Come

Do not rush into the contracts yet, there’s plenty to learn before that! We will cover a lot in this section, a prime focus will be on 'Invariance'. Though we've touched upon invariants in the Foundry Course, we never really delved into their significance, and when it comes to security, that's when you realize how crucial they are.

As a budding security researcher, it’s critical to understand and appreciate the weight that invariance carries. You'll learn to identify bugs without even looking at the code in-depth. Of course, this shouldn't be your only strategy in a security review, but through this session, we're demonstrating how critical and potent it can be.

We will be wielding an array of powerful tools, such as stateful fuzzing and fuzzing invariance. If you’re unfamiliar with freepy, don't worry, we will explore that as well.

## Dive Deeper into DeFi

DeFi experienced a surge in popularity recently. For those unfamiliar, DeFi, or decentralized finance, refers to financial services that are available on a public decentralized blockchain network. It eliminates the need for intermediaries and allows for a more open financial system.

Despite the intricacy, DeFi is relatively straightforward to grasp. With patience and perseverance, you will understand it. It's a concept that can seem daunting initially due to the complex terms used. In reality, most of the concepts are based on basic math.

We will dissect the Uniswap Protocol or the T swap protocol, a Decentralized Exchange in DeFi, and demystify it for better understanding. As we dive into the security review, we will use a myriad of robust tools to hack into the system.

> "A little progress each day adds up to big results."

This quote embodies the essence of our entire journey here. By the end of this section, you will have practically audited an entire Uniswap V1 in the audit data folder.

## A Bag Full of Exploits and Tooling

After diving under the hood of DeFi, we're going to learn a slew of new hacking techniques and tools. These include exploring esteemed toolkits like Echidna Foundry, examining concepts like consensus mutation testing and differential testing, and studying properties and exploits such as Weird ERC-20s callbacks, rebates, reentries, and core invariant breakings.

The prime focus for this session will be on understanding DFI and Invariance. Roughly going to the end of this section, you will have the experience of practically auditing the first-ever Uniswap created (Uniswap V1), commodities with a few of the bugs that I stumbled into during my journey.

## Get Set Go!

With everything I've shared with you, brace yourself for a thrilling juncture in Security and Auditing. Let's put on our thinking caps, get our VS code and popcorn ready, and dive right into T Swap. Together, we will crack the code and delve deeper into the world of DeFi.
