### Intro to TSwap

Alright! We should be feeling pretty good about ourselves. Hopefully you've just finished the Puppy Raffle section, ideally you signed up for [**CodeHawks**](https://www.codehawks.com/) (and maybe tried a contest or [**First Flight**](https://www.codehawks.com/first-flights) of your own!).

We've got a _lot_ more to cover.

Before we move on at all, you should take a look at this section on the [**GitHub Repo**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23?tab=readme-ov-file#-section-5-invariants--intro-to-defi--tswap-audit). You'll see right away - DO NOT LOOK AT THE CONTRACTS.

We're going to be learning how to use some advanced tooling and advanced testing concepts such as fuzzing, invariant testing and more.

In this section, we'll be reviewing the TSwap protocol ([**Repo**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/5-t-swap-audit)), it's a modified version of the Uniswap protocol. Uniswap is a DEX, or decentralized exchange.

Here we're going to challenge ourselves to find bugs without even looking at the code. Obviously this approach wouldn't be the norm, but the goal is to emphasize how powerful these tools and methods can be.

In addition to the testing approaches, we'll also go deep into DeFi covering concepts like:

- **AMMs (automated market maker)**
- **UniSwap and DEXs**
- **Curve.fi protocol**
- **Constant Product Formula**
- **Echidna**
- **Mutation Testing**
- **Rebase and Reentrancy Attacks**
- **Core Invariant Breaking**

Our manual review time is going to be limited as a product of all we'll cover, but these concepts are going to be incredibly important.

Fire up VS Code and let's get to it!
