## Step 1: Importing Files

Before we venture any further, we must first import the files we need. For instance, we've previously used a logo PDF file in our audit data folder, which you can easily repeat. Scope out your directories for relevant files before you start crafting your report.

## Step 2: Leveraging the Audit Report Template

Don't start creating your report from scratch! Utilize available templates to help guide you in building an informative and detailed review. You can find a well-crafted audit report template on our course page. To get the template, go back to the course, scroll upwards until you come across the template.

Simply copy the content from the raw version of the template and paste it into your new file called 'Report Template MD'.

## Step 3: Tailoring the Report

Having a template is splendid, but personalizing it to suit your audit changes the game. Let's rename the report template to '2020 311 one' and let's call it 'TSWAP audit MD'.

Feel free to insert the findings of your audit into the document. Let's add findings, a summary of the issues discovered and any recommendations you may have under the sections provided in the template.

> _Remember your findings should be as descriptive and detailed as possible to provide the most value._

To enhance your portfolio even further, spend some time writing up explanatory notes and if you had collaboration during the audit process, feel free to add their findings as well.

## Step 4: Updating the Details

Taking the time to update information accordingly is definitely vital. You might need to add audit details, scope, and list the issues you encountered. To visualize some parts of your report, say the risk classifications, you can include charts. Simply grab any chart you find illustrative enough and paste it into the report.

For example, you can provide the severity level of the identified issues found during your audit. We're going to say we found four high-risk issues, two of medium risk, and two of low risk. Informational issues can be many.

## Step 5: Finalizing and Converting the Report

Having updated the details, now is the perfect time to finalize your report. Set the report title, include your name(s), add protocol summary, risk classification, and audit scope details.

To convert the markdown file into a professional-looking PDF document, we can use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html), a very useful document converter.

And voila! Your PDF audit report is generated and ready for presentation, filled with detailed findings and code snippets.

## Step 6: Displaying Your Report

With the diligent work done, it's time to share your accomplishment to the world. Update your GitHub with the audit report or include a new report in your portfolio. Constantly creating and adding audit reports boosts your portfolio and betters your skills.

A job well done! By completing this tutorial, you've learnt to create a detailed, personalized audit report. Incredibly, through conducting audits, you've also gained substantive knowledge of DeFi protocols.

Remarkably, as we go through smart contracts- like the T-swap contract, a variation of Uniswap, you also gain substantial understanding of decentralized exchanges at the fundamental level.

Taking on real-world tutorials like these not only equip you with practical auditing skills but also provide you with a strong foundation in the fast-growing field of Decentralised Finance (DeFi).
