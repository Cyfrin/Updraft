### What is a Dex?

At it's highest level of abstraction what TSwap aims to do is: Allow users a permissionless way to swap assets between each other at a fair price.

TSwap (based off Uniswap) is an example of a Decentralized Exchange, or a `DEX`.

Check out the [**DEXes section of DeFiLlama**](https://defillama.com/protocols/Dexes) for a list of examples!

### What is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)?

TSwap is also en example of an Automated Market Maker (AMM).

Automated Market Makers are different from a typical "order book" style exchange. Instead of an order book which attempts to match buy and sell orders of users, an AMM leverages `Pools` of an asset. Uniswap is a great example of this. Check out the [**Uniswap Explained video by WhiteboardCrypto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLu35sIqVTM) to learn more in depth.

In our next lesson, we're going take a closer look at AMMs and how they differ from order book exchanges.
