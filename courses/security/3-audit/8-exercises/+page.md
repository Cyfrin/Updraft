ðŸŽ¯ Exercise: `Sign up for at least 1 security/web3 newsletter!`

The reason this is so important is that you are now a security _researcher_. Keyword - `researcher`. You need to constantly be learning and taking in new things.

In this course we're going to be studying other people's reports, studying other audits (using a tool called [**Solodit**](https://solodit.xyz/)) and we'll be continuously learning from previous exploits.

> Exploits in the space are learning opportunities for us to improve as security researchers.

Here are some newletters/resources to check out:

- [Blockchain Threat Intelligence](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/?r=2mgsm7) (referral link)
- [Solodit](https://solodit.xyz/)
- [Rekt](https://rekt.news/)
- [Week In Ethereum](https://weekinethereumnews.com/)
- [Consensys Diligence Newsletter](https://consensys.io/diligence/newsletter/)
- [Officer CIA](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/)

With all that said, you've now completed the high-level overview of what this process looks like. You should be very proud of yourself.

Take a break and prepare to dive into our first audit together - Puppy Raffle.
