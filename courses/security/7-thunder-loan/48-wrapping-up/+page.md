### Wrapping Up

This time, I'm not going to walk you through the reporting. This section is going to be a challenge I set to you to generate your own PDF report for this `Thunder Loan` section.

Remember, you can always reference the audit-data branch of the ThunderLoan repo for help. I've included a [**README**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/6-thunder-loan-audit/blob/audit-data/audit-data/README.md) detailing the steps to generate the PDF report as well as an [**example report**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/6-thunder-loan-audit/blob/audit-data/audit-data/report.pdf) to compare yours to.

Customize the report to your liking, but _do not_ skip this step. **_Actually_** create this report.

It's only through repetition that you'll build familiarity and get really good at these things, and you'll have a bad-ass new audit to add to your portfolio.

### First Flights

If you understood everything in this section, you're absolutely ready to sign up to `CodeHawks First Flights`. `Thunder Loan` was actually a code base which was featured in a `First Flight`, so you **are** ready to start gaining some real experience in a competitive audit.

Check out the currently active and upcoming First Flights [**here**](https://www.codehawks.com/first-flights).

Then, the next step is to join `CodeHawks` and jump into _real_ competitive audits. These mock code bases are not that far from many real protocols (they're literally forks!).

This section wasn't easy, a huge congratulations for getting this far.

Get pumped, test your skills out and once your PDF report is added to your profile, let's recap everything together in the next lesson.
