### Exploit - Storage Collision - Remix Example

To gain an even better understanding of the storage collision vulnerability, let's take a look at how it works with a [**Remix example**](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/Cyfrin/sc-exploits-minimized/blob/main/src/storage-collision/StorageCollision.sol&lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6.js).

StorageCollision.sol can be broken down into 3 distinct contracts.

- StorageCollisionProxy - This is the simple proxy contract for the protocol. It contains a setImplementation function and a few helper functions, including readStorage, which allows us to read from a storage slot, instead of a variable assignment.
- Implementation A - Allows user to setValue, storing a uint256.
- Implementation B - An upgrade to Implementation A, stores a modified version of a user's value, possesses a new `initialized` boolean.

    function setImplementation(address newImplementation) public {
        assembly {
            sstore(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT, newImplementation)
        }
    }

    function _implementation() internal view override returns (address implementationAddress) {
        assembly {
            implementationAddress := sload(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT)
        }
    }

    // helper function
    function getDataToTransact(uint256 numberToUpdate) public pure returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encodeWithSignature("setValue(uint256)", numberToUpdate);
    }

    function readStorage(uint256 storageSlot) public view returns (uint256 valueAtStorageSlot) {
        assembly {
            valueAtStorageSlot := sload(storageSlot)
        }
    }

    receive() external payable {
        _fallback();
    }
}

contract ImplementationA {
    uint256 public value;

    function setValue(uint256 newValue) public {
        value = newValue;
    }
}

contract ImplementationB {
    // Ah!!! This will ruin the storage of our proxy!!
    bool public initialized;
    // Why did we switch the order??
    uint256 public value;

    function setValue(uint256 newValue) public {
        value = newValue + 2;
    }
}
```

</details>


Of note, the `initialized` value will typically default to `0` or `false`, if any number is assigned to this variable, it's going to return `true`.

A contract reporting that it's initialized, when it's not, is a very risky situation.

Compile `StorageCollision.sol` and deploy our 3 contracts (Proxy.sol will show up in your list of contracts to deploy, you can ignore this file).

We can then set `Implementation A` via `StorageCollision::setImplementation`.

In order to interact with `Implementation A` in Remix now, we need to copy the address of our StorageCollisionProxy deployment, and add it to the `At Address` field. This will provide us a new contract field with which to interact.

::image{src='/security-section-6/45-exploit-storage-collision-remix-example/exploit-storage-collision-remix-example2.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

Go ahead and set any number (less than type(uint256).max ðŸ˜œ) as the value.

::image{src='/security-section-6/45-exploit-storage-collision-remix-example/exploit-storage-collision-remix-example3.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

Update the `At Address` field to configure our contract in Remix to be interacted with via our StorageCollisionProxy.

::image{src='/security-section-6/45-exploit-storage-collision-remix-example/exploit-storage-collision-remix-example4.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

From here, we should be able to updated the implementation address of our protocol by calling `setImplementation` and passing the address for `Implementation B`. We expect the logic of the protocol to change, but elements in storage should remain the same. Storage is handled by our proxy.

However, if we call `value` after setting our new implementation address, we see it's actually `0`.

::image{src='/security-section-6/45-exploit-storage-collision-remix-example/exploit-storage-collision-remix-example5.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

Worse than this, our new `initialized` variable seems to have defaulted to `true`!

**_What's going on here?!_**

In `Implementation B`, we can see that the `bool initialized` variable now holds the position that would be assigned to storage slot 0 and our value variable now resides in storage slot 1.

```js
contract ImplementationA {
    uint256 public value;
```

```js
contract ImplementationB {
    // Ah!!! This will ruin the storage of our proxy!!
    bool public initialized;
    // Why did we switch the order??
    uint256 public value;
```

This means, when we're checking our `initialized` value, storage slot 0 of our proxy is being referenced...but slot 0 isn't empty! Slot 0 contains the value we set from a previous implementation, which means `initialized` reads true!

We can confirm this by interacting with our StorageCollisionProxy contract and calling `readStorage` and passing our storage slot.

::image{src='/security-section-6/45-exploit-storage-collision-remix-example/exploit-storage-collision-remix-example6.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

Oh my goodness. This should illustrate clearly what a `storage collision` issue looks like, and our `ThunderLoanUpgraded` is falling for it hard.

Let's work on a PoC to showcase this in our audit report together, in the next lesson.

See you there!
