# **Understanding Centralization Risk in Contracts**

If you've written code for a smart contract, you may have come across this pesky medium-issue termed the 'centralization risk.' Often underplayed or regarded as a known non-issue, centralization risk holds the highly explosive capability to compromise your entire protocol.

In this article, we will dissect this concept, characterized by contracts with privileged owners who exercise undue rights to perform administrative tasks. These individuals demand a blind trust not to execute malicious updates or drain funds - a colossal deal in the world of protocols.

But, why should we report this in a private audit? Let's zoom in.

## **Why Centralization Risk Matters**

The alarm bells around centralization risks are not just blown for fun. There are hundreds of thousands of reasons to do so, primary being the inherent security issue. This vulnerability, if left unaddressed, can lead to the disastrous situation known as a 'rug pull.'

A metaphorical term, rug pull equates to the unanticipated withdrawal of liquidity from a protocol by its creators, rendering the protocol useless. Here's a quote aptly encapsulating this scenario:

> "Imagine someone pulling the rug off underneath your feet leaving you in a freefall. That's what is a rug pull."

Take a case wherein a contract is deployed, and it's vaunted as a decentralized entity. But the reality behind it is that itâ€™s actually behind a proxy. At any unpredictable time, the owners of this proxy could upgrade the contract, introducing functions like 'steal all the money' - definitely not cool.

## **A Deep Dive into SC Exploits Minimize Git Repo**

In the SC exploits minimize git repo associated with this course, we have chosen the SRC protocol's 'Thunder Loan.' We discovered that the protocol is rife with ownable actions. After sorting through 'Only Owner,' we spotted the functions set to allowed token, update Flash loan fee, and authorize Upgrade - all were exclusive to the owner.

Additionally, the owner of the protocol holds the power to modify all functionalities as per whims and fancies. This ownership is possible since the protocol is set behind a UUPS Proxy contract. It means that with one misstep, the entire protocol can be swept away.

It's not all bleak, though. Automated discovery tools like Adarin automatically seek centralization issues and generate comprehensive reports, minimizing the manual effort required to spot these vulnerabilities.

## **Exploring Further: Case Study of Oasis**

Before we wrap up, let's undertake a brief study of an excellent DeFi vulnerability challenge based on Oasis. The purpose of this exercise is to delve into the insecurities laid bare by unchecked centralization.

Our study highlighted that the contract owner could arbitrarily alter the balances of its users, effectively empowering the owner to rob the hard-earned ETH of its users. Consequently, this amplifies the centralization issue exponentially. This scenario mirrors an array of rug pulls stemmed from unchecked centralization.

## **Conclusion**

In the end, it all boils down to one fact - the presence of centralization poses a severe risk to the security of any protocol. Being proactive in acknowledging and mitigating this risk is non-negotiable if we aim to maintain the integrity of our protocols. Centralization can be a security issue, but with constant vigil, we can tackle it head-on.

Stay safe and happy coding!
