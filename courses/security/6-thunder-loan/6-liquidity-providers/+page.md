### Liquidity Providers

A natural question that arises from here is:

**_Where do funds for the loan initial come from?_**

The answer is a familiar one - `Liquidity Providers`!

Much like we saw in `TSwap`, where a `Liquidity Provider` would deposit funds into a pool to earn fees, the same takes place with `flash loans`.

A `Liquidity Provider` would deposit funds into a `flash loan` protocol, receiving some form of LP Token representative of their contribution. The `flash loan` protocol then accrues fees as people use `flash loans`, which increases the value of a `Liquidity Provider`'s representative allotment of the pool.
