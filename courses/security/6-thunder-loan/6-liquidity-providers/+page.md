# Deep Dive Into Flash Loans and Liquidity Providers

Welcome to another blog post in our crypto education series, where we explore the intriguing world of decentralized finance (DeFi) concepts. Today, we'll be focusing on the concept of Flash Loans, a highly popular instrument in the DeFi space. More specifically, we'll look at the role of those special behind-the-scene players called Liquidity Providers - their relationship with Flash Loans and how they gain from the system.

## The Concept of Flash Loans

For the uninitiated, Flash Loans are a DeFi innovation which enables borrowing of an asset without collateral, provided that the loan is repaid within the same transaction block. Now you may ask, how does money magically appear for these loans? And who provides this capital? Let's answer these.

## Understanding Liquidity Providers

Just like in traditional finance, the capital for loans don't just materialize out of thin air. The $1,000 or any amount of the Flash Loan is actually provided by what we call a "liquidity provider". In most cases, these are users (or "whales") who deposit a significant amount of money into a liquidity pool in a smart contract.

For instance, assume a user deposited $1,000 into a smart contract. This wouldn't be as simple as a one-sided transaction. Instead, they receive shares of the pool - a sort of 'receipt' denoting their contribution of $1,000 worth of tokens.

## The Flash Loan Process

The Flash Loan's working can be understood through a simple flow: the user requests the Flash Loan, borrows the money, and immediately pays it back. The USDC quickly cycles between the borrower and the liquidity pool.

It's important to note that Flash Loans are not free to utilize. Borrowers have to pay a small fee every time they borrow, often something as minuscule as a +0.1% on the borrowed amount.

## Earning Through Fees

Hereâ€™s where things get interesting for our liquidity providers. Every Flash Loan borrowed, and the associated fee, is accrued in the contract. So instead of just the original $1,000, the total pool keeps keeping amplified by the accrued fees e.g., $1,002, $1,003, and so on as more Flash Loans are taken.

In layman's terms, liquidity providers gather fees from every Flash Loan issued, making their investment worth it. Indeed, as succinctly summed up in this quote:

> "Because they deposited money to the protocol, they're going to get fees for people taking out these Flash loans."
