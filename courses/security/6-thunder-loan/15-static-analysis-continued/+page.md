# Aderyn Analysis Report

This report was generated by [Aderyn](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn), a static analysis tool built by [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io), a blockchain security company. This report is not a substitute for manual audit or security review. It should not be relied upon for any purpose other than to assist in the identification of potential security vulnerabilities.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

## L-2: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

- Found in src/protocol/OracleUpgradeable.sol [Line: 16](https://github.com/Cyfrin/6-thunder-loan-audit/blob/2250d81b89aebdd9cb135382e068af8c269e3a4b/src/protocol/OracleUpgradeable.sol#L16)

  ```solidity
          s_poolFactory = poolFactoryAddress;
  ```

## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

  ```solidity
      function isCurrentlyFlashLoaning(IERC20 token) public view returns (bool) {
  ```

## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## L-5: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

</details>

The remainder of detections by `Aderyn` are going to qualify as gas/informational findings. As such we'll likely just copy these outputs into our audit report - this is a huge time saving benefit of `Aderyn`.

Great first finding by `Aderyn`! What was pointed out next?

```
## L-2: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

- Found in src/protocol/OracleUpgradeable.sol [Line: 16](https://github.com/Cyfrin/6-thunder-loan-audit/blob/2250d81b89aebdd9cb135382e068af8c269e3a4b/src/protocol/OracleUpgradeable.sol#L16)
```

We've seen this one before! This is another great heads up to give the protocol. Navigate to the contract/line identified by the detector and let's add a note.

```js
function __Oracle_init_unchained(address poolFactoryAddress) internal onlyInitializing {
    // @Audit-Informational: Written in Aderyn
    s_poolFactory = poolFactoryAddress;
}
```

Do the same for the remainder of the findings identified in `Aderyn`'s report. We'll come back to these when we need to add them to our final write up!

```
## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

## L-5: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

## L-6: Empty Block
```

### Wrap Up

Whew, Slither and Aderyn have been very helpful in identifying some of these vulnerabilities already.

Pointing out vulnerabilities like centralization can at times be contentious, but it's an important part of our role as security researchers. Circumstances like the Oasis case study show that risks like these, while accepted by many protocols should be clearly communicated to people. That's where we come in.

Let's look at iPoolFactory.sol in the next lesson!
