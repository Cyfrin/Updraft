Welcome to our in-depth guide on how to run fork tests or mainnet fork tests. In a nutshell, fork tests help us create a simulated local version of mainnet to execute tests, thereby eliminating the need to include all contract addresses. Today, our walkthrough will show you how to accomplish this smoothly.

## Fork Testing with Alchemy URL

First off, we need to run the forage test. Simply type `forage test F` or `fork`, and add a URL such as Mainnet. By doing so, we create a pseudo-local version of Mainnet and run specific tests against it.

To acquire your Alchemy URL, simply visit Alchemy's website (Alchemy.com) and navigate to relevant sections. Remember, this URL is not for actual forking, but for fork testing.

```shell
ExampleforkURL = "https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key"
```

If this process does not work, set your Alchemy URL in the `.env` file.

```md
FORK_URL=https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key
```

)## Working with Mainnet Contracts Locally

Running `forge test --fork-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL`, lets you interact and work with mainnet contracts locally without deploying anything. This can save you considerable time and resources.
