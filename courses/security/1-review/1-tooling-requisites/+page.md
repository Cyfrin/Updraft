Hello to you all! I'm so excited for us to dive into a refresher of Solidity and Smart Contract coding. Even if you consider yourself an expert, or likewise a beginner, I'd love for you to join me on this section. It's always great to recap on existing knowledge and brush off the cobwebs, or if you're a newcomer, to get clarity on vital concepts. So, without further ado, let's jump right in!

## Pre-requisites: Your All-access Pass

Before we get deep into the coding trenches, there are some prerequisites to keep in mind.

One of the vital requirements is a dependable text editor. Personally, my favorite go-to tool is **Visual Studio Code**. However, for those more conscious of maintaining secure and private software, VSCodium serves as a fantastic alternative. It’s an open-source edition of VS Code, free from the drawbacks of Microsoft's additional features. Links to both options can easily be found [within this course's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23).

## Frameworks: Options and Solidity

The primary framework we'll be working with in this course is Foundry. But hey, if you’re more familiar with Hardhat, Brownie, or any other framework, don't stress; you can absolutely follow along using your tools. We'll be tackling some Foundry-specific tasks, but you're always welcome to adapt them for your framework of choice.

And if Foundry sparks a new interest for you, do check out [the installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation). Remember that running `foundryup` initiates an update of your Foundry tools, and `forge --help` prints a handy help guide on your terminal. Some of these tools include **Cast** and **Chisel**, both of which we'll get to learn more about in this course.

## Compatibility and Support: Make Your Tech Work For You

Should your workspace be a Windows machine, ensure you're using **Windows with a WSL**. This tool ensures the Linux terminal commands we run are compatible with your machine too. There's a brilliant [guide by Vasiliy](https://youtu.be/umepbfKp5rI?feature=shared&t=23546) walking you through the WSL installation process if you need it.

For Linux and Mac users, you can simply stick with the environments you're already using.

AI tools like Find or **ChatGPT** aid in seeking answers when you're out of your depths. One nifty feature Find offers is web searching; you can query "install Foundry for the ETH ecosystem", and the tool will surf the web, compile an answer, and offer you a digestible solution for your query!

## Impressive Resources, Team Work, and the Value of Learning

It is necessary to create accounts on platforms like **Piranha**, a Q&amp;A forum for web3, and **Ethereum Stack Exchange**, an invaluable resource for both asking questions and providing solutions. Also, a **GitHub repo** presence will prove handy, allowing you to access a multitude of resources.

> One of the worst things you can do as a security researcher is pretend you know something that you don't.

Honesty and confidence are essential values in this field; if you don't understand something, don't shy away - ask questions! Taking a humble stance and seeking assistance expedites your knowledge growth, assists others in learning, and boosts your confidence. Embrace the "I don't know, I will find out” attitude to strive for your best work.
