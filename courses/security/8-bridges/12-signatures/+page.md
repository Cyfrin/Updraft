### MessageHashUtils

The next library in L1BossBridge.sol, that we may not recognize is `MessageHashUtils`. This one's important, so let's spend a bit of time on it.

To understand what this is doing, we're going to have to go waaaay back to the [**Solidity Basis**](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/solidity) resource we used, the [**Anders Brown blockchain demo**](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/).

We'll be using his [**public-private-key-demo GitHub Repo**](https://github.com/anders94/public-private-key-demo) for this lesson.

> **Note:** You will need node.js to be able to experiment with this repo locally.

Begin by following the setup instructions on the repo's README.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anders94/public-private-key-demo.git
cd public-private-key-demo
npm install
```

To run the required server we can then run:

```bash
./bin/www
```

When can then open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser to access the locally hosted demo. Once set up, you can click on `signatures` in the top right and it should look something like this:

::image{src='/security-section-7/12-signatures/signatures1.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

Fundamentally a message signature takes a message, and hashes it with a user's private key.

::image{src='/security-section-7/12-signatures/signatures2.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

A public key can then be used to verify the signature on a message.

::image{src='/security-section-7/12-signatures/signatures3.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

If the message being verified has been changed, or if the public key doesn't match the signature, a message won't be verified.

With this understanding of how signatures work refreshed in our minds, we can come back to the MessageHashUtils contract. In order to make messaging and hashes more standardized a few Improvement Proposals have been made and adopted. One of which is [**ERC-191: Signed Data Standard**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191).

The motivation for ERC-191 is pretty clearly outlined in the proposal itself:

    Motivation

    Several multisignature wallet implementations have been created which accepts presigned transactions. A presigned transaction is a chunk of binary signed_data, along with signature (r, s and v). The interpretation of the signed_data has not been specified, leading to several problems:

    - Standard Ethereum transactions can be submitted as signed_data. An Ethereum transaction can be unpacked, into the following components: RLP<nonce, gasPrice, startGas, to, value, data> (hereby called RLPdata), r, s and v. If there are no syntactical constraints on signed_data, this means that RLPdata can be used as a syntactically valid presigned transaction.

    - Multisignature wallets have also had the problem that a presigned transaction has not been tied to a particular validator, i.e a specific wallet. Example:
      1.  Users A, B and C have the 2/3-wallet X
      2.  Users A, B and D have the 2/3-wallet Y
      3.  User A and B submit presigned transactions to X.
      4.  Attacker can now reuse their presigned transactions to X, and submit to Y.

So, basically, non-standardized signing practices were causing confusion and leaving room for attack vectors in ethereum transactions.

The standard proposed was that all signed data would follow the format:

```
0x19 <1 byte version> <version specific data> <data to sign>.
```

In this format the `version` denotes the type and structure of the data being signed.

::image{src='/security-section-7/12-signatures/signatures5.png' style='width: 100%; height: auto;'}

The example provided in the ERC does a great job at detailing how this works in practice.

```js
function signatureBasedExecution(address target, uint256 nonce, bytes memory payload, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public payable {

    // Arguments when calculating hash to validate
    // 1: byte(0x19) - the initial 0x19 byte
    // 2: byte(0) - the version byte
    // 3: address(this) - the validator address
    // 4-6 : Application specific data

    bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(byte(0x19), byte(0), address(this), msg.value, nonce, payload));

    // recovering the signer from the hash and the signature
    addressRecovered = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s);

    // logic of the wallet
    // if (addressRecovered == owner) executeOnTarget(target, payload);
}
```

`v, r, and s`, as we know are the constituent parts of a signature. These are hashed together via `keccak256`. The signer of this transaction is able to be recovered by using the EVM precompile `ecrecover`, this is effectively the verification step of a transaction.

A message and private key are run through the `ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)`, the result of this is our message signature which can be broken into our `v, r and s` elements. Smart contracts utilize the `ecrecover` precompile to verify who has signed something.

You can read more on the `ecrecover` precompile [**here, on evm.codes**](https://www.evm.codes/precompiled).
