## Hands-on Security Research with Solodit

Now to add a little fun to the mix. Visit Solodit, discover something that piques your interest, investigate old reported issues, and get on Twitter to share your findings! Why?

Creating a tweet thread about your discoveries will help you consolidate knowledge, engage with peers and seasoned pros, and gain valuable insights on the topic. Not to mention, you could be setting the foundation for your personal brand in the security research field. So don’t shy away from sharing; this field thrives on collaborative knowledge sharing – the more you share, the more you learn.

## The Journey Through Boss Bridge and Beyond

Congratulations are in order! You've conquered Boss Bridge and are on the brink of completing part one of this extensive dive into blockchain security. This is hard stuff, no doubt. But you're standing tall, arms loaded with hefty concepts, embracing the weird and the wonderful in the world of blockchain security.

Through this hurdle-ridden journey, you've gleaned a wealth of knowledge, but we're not done just yet. Let's pause for an important interlude - a pit-stop at miner extractable value (MEV).

## The Unskippable Chapter on Miner Extractable Value (MEV)

“While it's optional to do the Vault guardians audit or security review, learning about the miner extractable value (MEV) is obligatory. All our contracts could be susceptible to MEV-related breaches" - this just goes to show the significance of understanding miner extractable value (MEV) in the world of blockchain.

In the sections ahead, we'll dive into what MEV is, why it matters, and how we can fortify our contracts against potential issues stemming from it.

Now, go ahead and take that well-deserved break, grab that cup of coffee or make that gym run. Come back refreshed, because we've got a lot more in store for you!

## Wrapping Up

The world of technology is akin to a vast ocean, full of wonderful discoveries, but also home to some beastly challenges. This journey isn't meant to be a smooth sail. It's hard, and it’s meant to be. Embrace this rollercoaster ride and let the knowledge you gain empower you to make Web Three safer for all of us.

So kudos to you for making it this far; remember to rest and prepare for the next stint. Until then, happy learning!
