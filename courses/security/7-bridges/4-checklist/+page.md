# The Ultimate Auditor’s Checklist Method: The Hans

Have you ever wondered about the techniques that a talented and successful auditor uses (like the No.1 Web3 auditor, Hans), to keep everything organized? Well, wonder no more. Today, we are going to discuss an important tool Hans uses, a highly comprehensive checklist that we will explore here. The information might astonish you, so now is the time to buckle up for an Audit Adventure.

## The Power of a Checklist

The power of a checklist lies in the precision it can bring to a potentially massive process. By breaking down what might otherwise feel like a daunting task into structured and doable segments, checklists allow us to tread with confidence. Entertainment tech giant GitHub has embraced this approach by maintaining a repository-driven checklist entitled "audit checklist" for performing code audits.

> The checklist is part of an extensive repertoire of different attacks complete with links to Solidit, where these attacks have been reported, their implications and much more. Initially, it is in the JSON format, but will soon be hosted on Solidit for an enhanced user-friendly experience.

You can view and utilize this effective tool [here](https://github.com/Cyfrin/audit-checklist).

## Diving into the Checklist

The checklist dives instinctively into an attacker's mindset and focuses on a list of general checks for common attack types. Each section is meticulously designed to guide you through the audit process, complete with descriptions, remedial advice, references to potential attacks, and tags.

For instance, a section on "Reentrancy Attacks" includes questions you might ask to verify a system is safe from this category of assault. Questions like: "Are there any state changes after interaction with an external contract?" guide the process strategically.

The checklist covers other types of attacks, such as:

- Denial-of-Service
- Griefing Attacks
- Replay Attacks

The FAQ format ensures you’re doing your due diligence when evaluating a protocol. For example, under denial of service, you could inquire "Is the withdrawal pattern followed to prevent denial of service?" or scrutinize how the protocol manages tokens with blacklisting functionality – a point we have touched on before.

## Making It Your Own

Optimizing this checklist to suit your needs will help you make the most of it. You can do this by visiting the [Cyfrin GitHub audit checklist](https://github.com/Cyfrin/audit-checklist) and tweaking the JSON format to suit your preferences. The inclusion of your ideas not only makes the checklist more usable but also contributes to the creation of a collective knowledge base that benefits everyone.

## Going Beyond the Given

The nature of our industry means the checklist isn’t definitive. New issues and challenges come up that might not be covered by the current framework.

Therefore, this checklist remains a living document, one which requires continuous updating and refining. This could mean adding new issues to your list or making a pull request to include new questions that arise during the audit process.

## Conclusion

So there it is, the Auditor's Checklist Method by Hans. The roadmap to auditing a project, checking off every potential security vulnerability, ensuring that the protocol follows best practices.

Remember, the best use of this checklist comes not only from following it but also in reflecting upon its points and amalgamating your insights into it.

Happy auditing!
