### The Hans Checklist

In this section of the course, unlike the others, we're going to more closely apply **The Hans Checklist**.

Previously only on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/audit-checklist), this checklist is now [**hosted on Solodit**](https://solodit.xyz/checklist) directly!

This checklist serves as an itemized reference of things that should be checked when performing an audit. It breaks down a huge number of vulnerabilities and attack vectors as well as provides descriptions, references and remediations.

Each section of the checklist poses questions a security researcher should ask themselves to determine the risk and applicability to a code base they're reviewing.

If that wasn't enough, in addition to the conveniences above, this is a living document where open sources contributions are welcome and encouraged. By selecting `edit` an auditor is able to submit a new issue on GitHub to have vetted and added to the checklist.

This tool is incredibly valuable and I encourage you to get acquainted. We'll be putting it to good use throughout Boss Bridge.

In the next lesson, we'll gain a bit more context from the protocol docs, let's go!.
