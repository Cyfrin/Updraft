# Uncovering Hidden Bugs in Code Base: A Developer's Challenge

Today, let's delve into a particularly intriguing part of the code base that's rife with at least two major bugs. I encourage you to dig deep, find these bugs, and thoughtfully attempt to write them out. If you don't grasp the explanation right away, don't be discouraged - just refer to the GitHub repository linked to this section for a more comprehensive understanding of these bugs.

Even if the bugs are a bit cryptic in nature, Slither – our static analysis tool – has lobbed a figurative tip-off in our direction, indicating that things aren't all peaches and cream. So, let's proceed to unravel these bugs, shall we?

### When Things Go Wrong

The first bug we have on our hands isn't as straightforward as it might initially seem. This bug is associated with a code snippet that Slither flagged as suspicious or possibly detrimental.

```js
sendToL1(Arbitrary_message);
```

Is Slither's panic alarm warranted in this situation? Unfortunately, the answer, in this case, is a resounding **yes**. The bug is not just bad, it's downright dreadful.

#### Arbitrariness and the Hidden Flaws

What's the core problem, you ask? It all pertains to the way the `sendToL1` function passes arbitrary messages. In simple terms, the function is just accepting any given inputs without any verification system, which could be a potential security risk.

To grasp this problem, we need to understand the `vault` and its `approveTo` function. This particular function can only be called upon by the `bridge`.

```js
function approveTo(Bridge, Token) // Can only be called by the bridge
if (caller != Bridge){
    throwToken.totalSupply -= caller.balancecaller.balance = 0
    }
```

Now, imagine if someone triggers this `approveTo` function, passing malicious data asking the bridge to approve tokens for a hacker. Then, in record time, the hacker manages to drain all the tokens in the vault. Sounds like a dreadful fate, doesn't it? In the world of coding, this is just as destructive and catastrophic.

### Slither's Warning: A Red Flag

Aside from dire warnings about the first bug, Slither also gives us a prompt about another flaw in the system.

Identifying these issues is crucial for ensuring that our code remains secure, efficient, and, above all, bug-free. So, let's not sideline Slither’s red flags, and give them as much attention, if not more, as we would to the other parts of our code base.

## Conclusion

Bugs in your code base can range from harmless to a total catastrophe. Understanding them, and more importantly, identifying them before they wreak havoc, is a crucial part of any developer's journey. SO tune in next time when we delve into more bugs and how to debug them efficiently.

Stay curious and keep coding!
