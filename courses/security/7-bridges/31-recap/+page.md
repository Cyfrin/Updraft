Hello folks! You're in for an exciting ride as today we'll be diving deeper into the world of blockchain. We've covered a lot, but there's a whole universe waiting to be explored.

Before we jump into the next section, here's an assignment. Conduct a complete competitive audit. The essence of this exercise is to immerse you in Wallet Key management, which plays a significant role in blockchain.

There's more! We'll then delve into the depths of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Yule, Huff and Opcodes. We will close our session with four of verification and formal verification, symbolic execution - a mandatory code review that will boost your understanding of the subject.

Before that, let's quickly touch upon a DeFi Stablecoin and discuss the crucial step of post-deployment.

So let's take a breath, buckle up and review what we have learned so far!

## A Deep Dive into EVM Diff

Did I mention we will be exploring EVM Diff also? It's a fantastic tool that allows for comparison of different chains, say Ethereum to Optimism or Arbitrum, highlighting the nuances between these chains.

Through EVM Diff, you can observe how the chain IDs, names, block explorers vary, and how precompiles work differently. This makes it a constructive tool to test compatibility across various EVM compatible chains.

Now, it's not all smooth sailing. There might be some hiccups, like finding some precompiles in Arbitum which are absent in EVM or Arbitum’s different transaction and signature types. Plus, their Opcodes function a bit differently, with some key Opcodes like Push Zero being unsupported on Arbitrum.

## Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence

We haven’t delved too much into AI yet, but it's worth mentioning its relevance especially for the crypto enthusiast. Use AI, like Chat GPT, Elon Musk's new 'Find, Use Grok' to simplify things in blockchain. It can be a helpful tool when decoding intricate patterns or asking pertinent questions.

In our roadmap, we have upcoming plans for an AI helper for [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io) that will be a game-changer. So, that's something to look forward to!

## The Importance of Checklist: A Lesson from Tenderly and The Hans

Yes, the age-old practice of running through checklists is crucial, even in something as modern as blockchain.

Although we didn’t discuss [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/), it's a notable tool in this domain. Our focus was on the lessons from 'the Hans' stressing on the essentiality of having a checklist. These lists keep you on track, enabling a methodical approach to your manual review process.

## Understanding Precompiles, Private Keys and Signatures

We mentioned polygon precompile during our case study, emphasizing on how crucial it is to cross-verify and how failing to do so can be costly.

We've delved into the concept of public and private keys and how these signatures work on-chain. The importance of nonce in signature replays was discussed - they work as a one-time pass for usage ensuring your signatures don't get misused.

We touched on several critical aspects, like undertaking low-level calls and dealing with the sign in it, and also brushed up on L1s and L2s.

By now, you should be competent enough to write your own Proof of Concepts (POCs). The ball is in your court!

## Historic Bridge Hacks - Ronan, Polly Nomad and Wormhole

We intentionally didn't touch upon these major blockchain hacks. Each of these hacks had a devastating effect, with losses running into hundreds of millions. However, they were mainly due to centralized processes, rather than any significant bug.

Reading [Rekt.news](https://www.rekt.news/) articles about these hacks will help you comprehend the magnitude of these events. The rise of protocols like chainlink CCIP is to address these vulnerabilities, aiming to diminish our reliance on centralized technology.

This is a lot to absorb, but remember, the world of crypto and blockchain is a non-stop learning journey. So keep exploring and evolving.
