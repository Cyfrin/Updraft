## Forking Mainnet

Forking is a valuable tool is a developer's box, it effectively takes a reference snapshot at a given block height on the provided chain. In practice, this allows us to interact with protocols as though we were interacting with them on mainnet.

## Fork Tests in Foundry

```bash
forge test fork-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
```

This command in foundry tells the framework to run your tests while referencing a fork of the provided RPC URL, allowing you to interact with mainnet contract locally.

Another way to fork is within the test contract directly.

```js
function setUp() public {
    vm.createSelectFork({blockNumber: 0, urlOrAlias: "mainnet"})
}
```

> Note: `mainnet` will need to be set as an alias in your `foundry.toml` under a new variable `[rpc_endpoints]`

```toml
[rpc_endpoints]
mainnet = "{MAINNET_RPC_URL}"
```

With the above in place running the following will run your tests with respect to a fork of a live chain!

```bash
forge test
```
