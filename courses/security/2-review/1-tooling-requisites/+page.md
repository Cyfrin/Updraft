## Pre-requisite Tools

Before we get deep into coding, there are some useful tools we're going to be using throughout the course. Best to prepare them now.

Firstly, you will need some kind of IDE or text editor. I like to use [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/). For those of you more security and privacy focused you may want to check out [**VSCodium**](https://vscodium.com/) which removes a lot of the Microsoft _stuff_.

## Frameworks

The primary framework we'll be working with in this course is Foundry. You can view installation instructions for that [**here**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

But hey, if youâ€™re more familiar with [**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/), [**Brownie**](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), or any other framework, don't stress; you can absolutely follow along using your tools. We'll be tackling some Foundry-specific tasks, but you're always welcome to adapt them for your framework of choice.

> Remember: You can use commands `foundryup` to update your Foundry tools and `forge --help` to access a help guide.

Additional Foundry specific features we'll be using include `cast` and `chisel`, both of which we'll learn more about in this course.

## Coding Environment

If you're using a PC with Windows, ensure you're using **Windows with WSL**.

This tool ensures the Linux terminal commands we run are compatible with your machine too. There's a brilliant [**guide by Vasiliy**](https://youtu.be/umepbfKp5rI?feature=shared&t=23546) walking you through the WSL installation process if you need it.

For Linux and Mac users, you can simply stick with the environments you're already using.

AI tools like [**Phind**](https://www.phind.com/) or [**ChatGPT**](https://www.chat.openai.com) aid in seeking answers when things get tough. One nifty feature **Phind** offers is web searching; you can query "_install Foundry for the ETH ecosystem_", and the tool will surf the web, compile an answer, and offer you a digestible solution for your query!

## Web3 Is About Community

I highly recommend you consider creating accounts on platforms like:

- [**Peeranha.io**](https://peeranha.io/) - A great platform for discussion and QA for Web3
- [**Ethereum Stack Exchange**](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/) - One of _the_ best blockchain developer resources available
  and of course
- [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com) - Every developer needs an account here. It's objectively the best space online to collaborate, discuss and share coding support.

Remember to jump in and ask questions. Don't pretend to have answers when you don't. The learning experience is about being humble and is most rewarding to those willing to ask questions and seek clarity. Embrace the "I don't know, and I will find out" attitude.

> One of the worst things you can do as a security researcher is pretend to know something you don't.
