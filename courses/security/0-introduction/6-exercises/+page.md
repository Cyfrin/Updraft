### Section 0: Exercises

The first exercise is important. This is **just for you**. This isn't meant to be a motivation to share with others, or chat about publicly, this is what inspired you to take the first step and what will continue to inspire you to take the next.

_This is for you._

Make it as long and detailed as possible. Pour your emotion into defining why you want this. Don't bullsh\*t yourself. There'll be opportunities to shout your accomplishments loudly - but this is just for you.
