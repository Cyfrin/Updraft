## Best Practices

Welcome to our Smart Contract Security course! I'm super excited to guide you through this journey. Let‚Äôs make sure you get the absolute best out of it.

Essential Resources:

- Cyfrin Updraft - If you're reading this, you're already here. All the most up to date corrections, content and updates will be available here, as accessible as ever and as part of a community eager to help.
- GitHub Repo - The [Security and Auditing Full Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23) repo is going to be your bible throughout this course. It is packed with all the code and references you need to succeed.

Now, let's talk about how you can really get into the groove of things:

- **Code Along**: Trust me, coding along with me during the lessons will make things stick way better. Have the video up along with your IDE of choice and follow along. Actually going through these motions are what will commit them to memory.
- **Join the Chat on GitHub**: Got questions? Want to chat with others? Head over to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23/discussions) tab. It's a great spot to talk things out.
- **Stay Up-to-Date**: Remember, the world of coding changes fast. Keep an eye on Cyfrin Updraft for the latest and greatest in course content.
- **Dive into the Community** - We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/cyfrin) server that is great for networking with fellow students and being involved in the community. Join us and share your successes and help others! To go far, we go together!

About your learning pace ‚Äì everyone's different, right? So:

- **Take Breaks**: They‚Äôre not just okay, they‚Äôre necessary! Your brain will thank you.
- **Control the Tempo**: Feel free to speed up or slow down the videos. Video playback settings are available to control the pace.
- **Keep Track of Your Journey**: Use those timestamps in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23) to bookmark your progress.
- **Jump Around**: The course is set up so you can hop between sections as you like. Reflect on each lesson to really make it stick.

And don‚Äôt forget, you‚Äôre not alone in this:

- **Connect with the Community**: There are awesome places like [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/) and various decentralized Q&A forums, not to mention GitHub, for some solid discussion and collaboration.
- **Learn Together**: The blockchain and smart contract space is all about teamwork and sharing knowledge. So, getting involved with others will only boost your learning.
