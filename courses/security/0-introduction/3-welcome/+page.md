## The Future of Web3: A focus on Security

Welcome to the future of Web3 security; welcome to what is possibly the most comprehensive course on this subject ever created! As smart contract developers continue to bloom, it becomes imperative to ensure that the security scene keeps up. That’s the core focus of this guide - to level up the game and ensure a safer environment in the Web3 space.

> _"Security is one of the most important things to unlocking the future of Web3."_

With multiple detailed courses delivered in the past, dedicated to helping novice and intermediate smart contract developers enhance their skills. The accompanying study materials have garnered over 5.5 million views, making them the most-watched smart contract development courses on the planet. Thousands of budding developers have thus started their Web3 journey, equipped with the right knowledge and skills. They are now activated and productive developers in the Web3 space.

This guide, however, is not for the newcomers. It's an advanced course aimed at those familiar with smart contracts and comfortable with terms like _storage_, _self-destruct_, _fallback functions_, and _ERC20s_. A refresher will be offered at the beginning, but the primary focus will be to provide learners with intensive training in smart contract auditing and research.

## Expert Opinions Matter

It's always enriching to learn from the best, and this guide takes care of that too. Featuring guest lecturers who are renowned experts in smart contract development:

1. Josselin from Trail of Bits
2. Owen from Guardian Audience
3. Andy from Sigma Prime
4. Johnny Time from Gingersec
5. Pashov, legendary security researcher.
6. Hans, one of the top competitive auditors.
7. Tincho, the former lead auditor at Openzeppelin.

With these experts by your side, not only will you gain in-depth insights, but also get to explore extensive and carefully curated code samples. A special shout-out to Tincho, who has been actively supporting the development and auditing of the codes that will be discussed in detail.

## Mastering The Skills: Developer to Researcher

People planning to take up this course should have a basic understanding of blockchain basics, solidity fundamentals, and working with a smart contract framework such as Hardhat or Foundry. We will primarily focus on Foundry in this guide, but the skills learned can easily be transferred to other frameworks as well.

The course is not just for auditors; it is also aimed at training security researchers. Because who better to explore and learn about new attacks and analyze possible advances in smart contract technologies than a researcher?

The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23) associated with the course offers a detailed curriculum and additional resources. If you are already familiar with certain sections, feel free to skip directly to the ones that you need help with or wish to learn more about.

## A Peek into the Future

We want you to learn effectively, and that's where Cyfrin Updraft comes into play. It's a tool developed to HyperCharge your learning experience and help you grasp things faster. It’s free to sign up for those interested.

You are perfectly up to speed with the prerequisites if you have already taken the Foundry full course. Access more resources to get up to speed in the GitHub repo associated with the post.
