# Taking on the Challenge: Navigating the Puppy Raffle Codebase

Welcome to another exciting exploration into the world of programming, where we tangle with codebases and debug in the quest for learning and continuous improvement. We have a very thrilling activity lined up for you in this guide. We’re going to dive deep into the belly of a beastly codebase and find the bugs lurking within.

So ready your development kit and clear your schedules, we’re about to discover how it feels to do this all by ourselves!

First, let’s get a few things in order. Here is what you need to do:

1. **Resist the temptation** to peek at the audit data branch. This section holds the answer key to the problems we’re trying to solve, and we won't get anywhere looking at that!
2. **Spend some devoted time** working on this challenge by yourself. Maybe spend a solid 30 minutes on it. If that feels too long or frustrating, feel free to take a break.

Your mission is to review, find bugs, and rectify them as best as you can.

## The Phenomenal Playground

Now, why are we doing this? Well, not only does this exercise help you test your skills and get some real coding experience, but it also gives you a good feel for the kind of challenges you might face when you’re working on your own projects.

> "This codebase is a phenomenal playground for you to test your skills and see how you're doing."

The objective isn’t just to find as many bugs as you can, but to understand their impact, their cause and most importantly, how to fix them. This first-hand experience can be invaluable in developing the skills and patience necessary to debug future projects.

## The Adventure Begins

Here’s a glimpse of the rollercoaster ride you can expect during this debugging process:

```
I don't understand this. Wait, I don't get it. Oh, I think that's a bug. I don't understand this. Oh, my God. I found something. I am a brilliant wizard. I don't understand this. Was this yep, that's definitely a bug. Okay, write that up.
```

It's perfectly alright to alternate between confusion and comprehension, elation and frustration. These fluxes are part of the process, part of the journey.

Now that you're all prepped, it's time for you to tackle the Puppy Raffle codebase. Find as many bugs as you can, write them up, bask in that brilliant wizard feeling when you do find them, and always remember to keep going.

Once you've given it a good shot, we'll come back together and walk through the codebase. We'll compare notes, discuss the bugs found, and delve into how to fix them.

But for now, unleash your debugging prowess, and let's see how you do in this coding challenge. Dive in, get lost, be frustrated, but most importantly, enjoy the process of discovering and learning.

Take at least 20 minutes to fully immerse yourself and accept the challenge. Unleash the brilliant wizard inside you and get cracking!
