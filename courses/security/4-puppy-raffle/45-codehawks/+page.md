Once your details are entered, click the `Sign Up` button at the bottom, your wallet will pop up and you'll be prompted to sign a transaction (no fees).

You'll then receive a notification to verify your email, but following that **you're all done!** That's all it takes to get started with participating in competitive audits on the CodeHawks platform, and you already possess the basic skills to get involved.
