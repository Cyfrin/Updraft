# Celebrating Your Accomplishments and Preparing for the Next Challenge in Crypto-Audit

Hooray for you! You have successfully completed your puppy raffle audit. If you're wondering what's next, you're in the right place. Let's not keep that excitement to ourselves.

## Post a Tweet About Your Achievement

Go ahead and share your success on Twitter. There's no better way to share the news than a straightforward, cheerful tweet. If you're not sure how to compose your tweet, don't worry. I got you covered.

> "Celebrating your wins publicly not only helps you keep track of your progress but also encourages others to keep going."

## Try Farcaster: A Web3 Social Media

As you continue your foray into the crypto-space, why not check out a more Web3 focused social platform? I'd recommend signing up for [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/), a new venture into decentralized social media. It's an exciting area to explore alongside your security auditing work.

## Do a CodeHawks First Flight

Now that you have a puppy raffle audit under your belt, it's a great time to embark on a CodeHawks First Flight. These missions are designed specifically for someone like you—someone who understands security, knows Solidity, and wants to start working on fast-paced, competitive audits and expand their skill set.

The great thing about CodeHawks First Flights is that they can be quick to start and complete. Jump in and try any active first flight. If you're in a competitive mood, you can even attempt a full competitive audit. But no pressure, if you'd rather wait and focus on deepening your understanding of DeFi security, rest assured there are some powerful DeFi security review sessions coming up soon.

## Commend Yourself for The Milestone Achieved

Regardless of what you choose to do next, take a moment to pat yourself on the back. You've made it this far and it's no small feat. You've gotten a real feel for what it's like to be a security researcher—diving into code bases, writing reports, looking for vulnerabilities, and spotting potential bugs based on past experiences.

Remember, in this field, repetition is the name of the game. The more audits you carry out, the more skilled you will become.

```js
console.log(
  "Congratulations on getting this far! Now, go enjoy some ice cream."
);
```

Having savored your victory, get ready for the next level of challenges. Find us in our next section, where we'll delve deep into invariants and DeFi with T-Swap. So far, it's been fun and games, but we're about to broadly level up your skill set.

Use this break to tweet or cast about your experiences, then gear up for the upcoming section. I'm excited to see you back here soon! Until then, continue celebrating, and remember - every success in crypto-audit is another leap forward in this world of blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies.

Bye for now, and see you soon in Section Five!
