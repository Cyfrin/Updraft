### Introducing Aderyn: A Rust Based Static Analysis Tool

The second powerful tool we'll be using in this course is a Rust-based analyzer, [**Aderyn**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn). This tool was created by the smart contract developer legend [**Alex Roan**](https://github.com/alexroan).

### Installation of Aderyn

Before we can use `Aderyn`, we'll need to first install `Rust`. Like `Slither`, we won't go over the specifics of installation, but you can find a guide with installation options available to you [**here**](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

> Remember: If you have issues with installation, AI is great at helping with this, you can also leverage the communities on Stack Overflow!

Once `Rust` has been installed, you can run the command `cargo install Aderyn`. This will install our tool.

> **Note:** If you've already installed Aderyn, this command will also update you to the current version. Your terminal will advise if the tool is already installed.

### Running Aderyn

To run Aderyn, the command is `Aderyn [OPTIONS] <root>`. Since we're already in the root directory of our project, we can just run:

```bash
aderyn .
```

Running this command will compile our contracts, our terminal will display the usual compilation warnings - at the bottom of the output however, we can see _`Detectors run, printing report. Report printed to ./report.md`_

We should see this fine in our IDE explorer. If we open it up...

# Aderyn Analysis Report

This report was generated by [Aderyn](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn), a static analysis tool built by [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io), a blockchain security company. This report is not a substitute for manual audit or security review. It should not be relied upon for any purpose other than to assist in the identification of potential security vulnerabilities.

# Medium Issues

## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

  ```solidity
  contract PuppyRaffle is ERC721, Ownable {
  ```

  ```solidity
      function changeFeeAddress(address newFeeAddress) external onlyOwner {
  ```

# Low Issues

## L-1: `abi.encodePacked()` should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`

Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will [prevent hash collisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred. If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` [instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739).
If all arguments are strings and or bytes, `bytes.concat()` should be used instead.

  ```solidity
              abi.encodePacked(
  ```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 201](https://github.com/Cyfrin/4-puppy-raffle-audit/blob/15c50ec22382bb1f3106aba660e7c590df18dcac/src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L201)

  ```solidity
                          abi.encodePacked(
  ```

## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 2](https://github.com/Cyfrin/4-puppy-raffle-audit/blob/15c50ec22382bb1f3106aba660e7c590df18dcac/src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L2)

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
  ```

## L-3: Conditional storage checks are not consistent

When writing `require` or `if` conditionals that check storage values, it is important to be consistent to prevent off-by-one errors. There are instances found where the same storage variable is checked multiple times, but the conditionals are not consistent.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 140](https://github.com/Cyfrin/4-puppy-raffle-audit/blob/15c50ec22382bb1f3106aba660e7c590df18dcac/src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L140)

  ```solidity
          if (rarity <= COMMON_RARITY) {
  ```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 142](https://github.com/Cyfrin/4-puppy-raffle-audit/blob/15c50ec22382bb1f3106aba660e7c590df18dcac/src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L142)

  ```solidity
          } else if (rarity <= COMMON_RARITY + RARE_RARITY) {
  ```

  ```solidity
          uint256 rarity = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.difficulty))) % 100;
  ```

## NC-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.
