# Unearthing a Denial of Service (DoS) Bug

If you have a keen interest in cybersecurity, cryptography, or perhaps dabble a bit in code, then you're in for a thrilling and insightful read! Today, let's talk about a particular bug type known as the _Denial of Service (DoS)_ bug – we shall delve into it and explore its inner workings using a minimized example from the Cyfrin Security and Auditing Full Course GitHub repo.

Excitingly, this DoS is the first bug we've identified. To provide a detailed understanding of this, we'll be looking at a more simplified variation of this bug.

To get started, go to the \[_Cyfrin Security and Auditing Full Course GitHub repo_\](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23) (you might want to zoom out a bit for an easier view). Scroll back to the top, then navigate to 'welcome to the course'. In this section, you’ll find resources for the course - scroll down to the 'resources' section.

## Utilizing the 'sc-exploit-minimized' Repository

On accessing the _sc-exploit-minimized_ repository, you find yourself in an informative hub brimming with simplified examples of the bugs we're covering. It provides a great chance for you to study and practice them. Additionally, example contracts are made available on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), a powerful open source tool that helps you write smart contracts in Solidity.

![](https://cdn.videotap.com/rsCebPuyEmgS3Hkm0UQ9-49.58.png)At the bottom of the _sc-exploit-minimized_ repository, you have buttons you can click on to access these example contracts on Remix, and experiment with them. You can also find _Capture The Flag_ challenges that allow you to practice bug identification in realistic scenarios within games like _Damn Vulnerable DeFi_ and _Ethernaut_, among others.

```markdown
> **NOTE**> Remember, practicing with actual examples in real-time simulations is crucial to mastering the bug identification process.
```

## A More Detailed Look at the Denial of Service Bug

To further analyze this DoS bug, navigate to the SRC folder. It holds various other bugs we'll cover in future posts. For now, delve into the Denial of Service folder (Dos) for a minimalist illustration of a DoS bug.

Once inside, scroll down until you find 'Denial of Service'. Here, click on the Remix button that will direct you to the Remix IDE which comes preloaded with the code base we'll be working with in this blog.

![](https://cdn.videotap.com/Rfdo8u2omH90wiKb0Ix1-89.25.png)If this redirect fails, simply open 'SRC Denialofservice Dos Sol' manually and copy-paste the code into Remix. Voila! You're all set to delve into our first bug – the Denial of Service bug!

```markdown
> **PRO TIP**> For experiencing code in a hands-on way, using a versatile platform like Remix can be incredibly beneficial. It's like being in a virtual lab where you can manipulate code, learn, and grow.
```

Stay on this journey as we continue to uncover and understand more cybersecurity and cryptographic bugs!
