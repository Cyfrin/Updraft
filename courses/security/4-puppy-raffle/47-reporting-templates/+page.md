# The Art of Writing Github Audit Reports

Welcome to this informative guide on creating top-notch GitHub audit reports. If youâ€™ve been following our series of report-writing tutorials, then you're at the right place to take a deeper dive!

## Utilizing Our Audit Report Templates

Firstly, let's start by exploring our wonderfully diverse GitHub repository. You may recall this same audit report templating repo _"password store"_ from our previous tutorial.

However, besides this, there are numerous other templates in the repository that can be of great use. Feel free to pick any according to your needs or project requirements.

## The Power of Audit Repo Cloner

Now, some of you might remember our good friend, the _"Audit Repo Cloner"_. This handy tool developed by our enthusiastic Cyfrin team, takes clone of a repo and prepares it automatically for Cyfrin audit report generation. In order to streamline our audits, instead of amassing all of our findings on a markdown, we use issues or projects on the repo and generate the entire report directly from GitHub.

## The Report Generator Template

Within our arsenal, we also have a powerful ally called _"Report Generator Template"_. Forked from Spearbit, this phenomenal codebase performs a myriad of functions such as:

1. Fetching all issues from a repository.
2. Arranging them according to severity.
3. Generating a single markdown file.
4. fusing the markdown file into a latex template.
5. Alongside producing a PDF version of the entire report.

Therefore, knowing how to manoeuvre through our repository, using the correct tools efficiently, and utilizing our audit report templates is essential.

## The Importance of Collaborative Audit Reports

When collaborating with your team, instead of attempting to merge everyone's markdown notes together, you may prefer to add issues directly, inputting your findings there. In this way, not only does teamwork become straightforward but also these tools can automatically generate the report from the issues, reducing the effort required.

Learning to write audit reports in this manner is a step towards mastering report-writing. However, since we're still honing our skills, we'll continue writing in one markdown file and then generate them with the help of our audit report templating codebase.

## Mastering the Art of Report Writing

Since report writing is an indispensable skill for auditors, it's time to practice writing an audit report. Not every audit will require a meticulous report; sometimes a simple Markdown summary of your findings will suffice. But as part of your training, you must not neglect to practice and perfect your writing skills.

## Leveraging Proof of Codes

Another critical factor to remember is proving your findings with corroborating codes, known as _'Proof of Codes'_. These are extremely vital, particularly in competitive audits. A finding without accompanying proof could be easily dismissed or overlooked in favour of findings that offer clear validations. Thus, developing clear and concise _Proof of Codes_ is key to succeeding in both competitive and private audits.

In summary, compiling an impactful audit report necessitates familiarity with tools like Audit Repo Cloner and Report Generator Template. Integrating these with prudent collaboration and judicious use of templates can lead to seamless report generation. Lastly, let's not forget the importance of providing strong _Proof of Codes_ to give validation and weight to our findings.

I hope this guide fills you with newfound confidence and propels you towards creating expert-level GitHub audit reports. Good luck with your journey! Keep auditing and keep improving.
