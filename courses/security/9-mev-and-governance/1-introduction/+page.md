### Introduction

Welcome back! I hope you took the time to complete some of the exercises in the previous section. I cannot stress enough how helpful the practice will be long term.

_Repetition is the mother of skill._

Doing the exercises and taking the steps beyond following the course material is really important and is really going to establish the strong foundations needed to succeed as a security researcher.

Everyone learns a little differently, but find what works for you and **stick with it**.
