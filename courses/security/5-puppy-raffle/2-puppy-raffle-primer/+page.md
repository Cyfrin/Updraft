### Puppy Raffle Primer

Alright! Before we jump into this process I want to mention a couple things:

1. Do **not** look at the `audit-data` branch of the course [**repo**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/4-puppy-raffle-audit). This is our `answer key`.

2. Take some time to scope the codebase yourself before proceeding. Try to go through the process we just did with PasswordStore and challenge yourself to find what you can here.

Don't spend _too much_ time trying things yourself. Spend 20-30 minutes doing your best and if you feel like you're getting nowhere, or you're unsure what to do - just stop. We can do it together.

If you feel like you're cooking and you've found a few bugs - keep going. Repeating this process and becoming comfortable with doing it yourself is an important part of learning.

Puppy Raffle is a phenomenal codebase to gain valuable security review experience on. So try your best on your own first, and when you're ready - let's move onto the Scoping phase together!
