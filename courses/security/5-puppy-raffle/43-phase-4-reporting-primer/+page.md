### Writing the Report

As was mentioned before - you can always look at one more line of code, but at some point, you got to _write the report_.

Now, we're satisfied with our review, we're happy with the job we did. Lets write things up. We're going to go through the report together again as this is a crucial skill for your future security researcher career.

In audits and especially in bug bounties, it is your obligation to convince the protocol of the importance of your finding and the need for it to be fixed. Writing detailed and thorough audit reports is the avenue through which we do this.

BUT. Before we walkthrough another report, I want to introduce you to competitive audits. We're going to go over what they are, how they differ from private audits and how to submit a finding for them.

For now - if you've been binging this course, I want you to pause and go for a walk. It's time to take a break and reward ourselves for how far we've come. We've learnt so much, and we've so much more to go.

See you after your break!
