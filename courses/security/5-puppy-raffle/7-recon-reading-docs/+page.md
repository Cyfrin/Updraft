### Context from Documentation

Ok, we've scoped things out. Let's start with step 1 of `The Tincho` - Reading the documentation.

What we've been provided is a little sparse - but read through the README of [**Puppy Raffle**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/4-puppy-raffle-audit).

# Puppy Raffle

This project is to enter a raffle to win a cute dog NFT. The protocol should do the following:

1. Call the `enterRaffle` function with the following parameters:
   1. `address[] participants`: A list of addresses that enter. You can use this to enter yourself multiple times, or yourself and a group of your friends.
2. Duplicate addresses are not allowed
3. Users are allowed to get a refund of their ticket & `value` if they call the `refund` function
4. Every X seconds, the raffle will be able to draw a winner and be minted a random puppy
5. The owner of the protocol will set a feeAddress to take a cut of the `value`, and the rest of the funds will be sent to the winner of the puppy.

Above we see a pretty clear description of the protocol and it's intended functionality. What I like to do is open a `notes.md` file in my project and summarize things in my own words.

Use this notes file to record your thoughts as you go, it'll make summarizing things for our report much easier later.

Let's take a look at some of the code that powers the expected functionality in the next lesson.
