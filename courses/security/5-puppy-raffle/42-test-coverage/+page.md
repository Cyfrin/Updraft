### Checking Coverage

Alright! Let's see where we're at in our roadmap

```
Slither ✅
Aderyn ✅
Code Quality/Tests

Reporting
- Competitive Audits
    - Submit a finding
- Puppy Raffle Report incl. PoC
```

Test coverage is up next, this should be easy.

> **Remember:** you can check test coverage with the command `forge coverage`.

This is ... pretty bad. In the context of a competitive audit, this may be less important, but in a private audit we should absolutely be calling this out as an informational. Assuring a repo has an adequate test coverage helps a protocol avoid overlooking areas of their code.

In the next lesson, we'll be going over some details to ready ourselves for writing this report. Exciting!
