Don't hesitate to jump in and get as much experience actually going through these processes as you can.

Once your details are entered, click the `Sign Up` button at the bottom, your wallet will pop up and you'll be prompted to sign a transaction (no fees).

You'll then receive a notification to verify your email, but following that **you're all done!** That's all it takes to get started with participating in competitive audits on the CodeHawks platform, and you already possess the basic skills to get involved.

Let's go over how to submit a finding in a competitive audit so you're truly prepared to jump in!
