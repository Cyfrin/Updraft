### Starting with the Code

What I like to do when first assessing a codebase is to start at the `main entry point`. Sometimes this area of a protocol may be a little unclear, but using Solidity: Metrics can help us out a lot.

Pay special attention to the functions marked `public` or `external`. Especially those which `modify state` or are `payable`. These are going to be certain potential attack vectors.

> **Note:** In Foundry you can use the command `forge inspect PuppyRaffle methods` to receive an output of methods for the contract.

I would start with the `enterRaffle` function. Let's take a look.

```js
/// @notice this is how players enter the raffle
/// @notice they have to pay the entrance fee * the number of players
/// @notice duplicate entrants are not allowed
/// @param newPlayers the list of players to enter the raffle
function enterRaffle(address[] memory newPlayers) public payable {
    require(msg.value == entranceFee * newPlayers.length, "PuppyRaffle: Must send enough to enter raffle");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
        players.push(newPlayers[i]);
    }

    // Check for duplicates
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
        for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
            require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
        }
    }
    emit RaffleEnter(newPlayers);
}
```

Starting with the `NatSpec` we may have a few questions rise.

- _What's meant by # of players?_
- _How does the function prevent duplicate entrants?_

Write questions like these in your `notes.md` or even as `@audit` notes inline. These are things we'll want to answer as we progress through the code.

###

One thing I notice in our next few lines is - I don't really love their naming conventions. `entranceFee` is immutable and nothing in this function makes that clear to me (unless I'm using [**Solidity Visual Developer**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tintinweb.solidity-visual-auditor)).

Were this a private audit, I may start an `Informational` section in my `notes.md`.

```
## About

> The project allows users to enter a raffle to win a dog NFT.

## Informational

`PuppyRaffle::entranceFee` is immutable and should follow a more clear naming convention

    ie. `i_entranceFee` or `ENTRANCE_FEE`
```

### Wrap Up

We're going to be bouncing between `Recon` and `Vulnerability` phases a bit in the Puppy Raffle review. Sometimes the lines can be a little blurry, but you'll find a workflow that works well for you with time and experience.

Let's go back to the code.
