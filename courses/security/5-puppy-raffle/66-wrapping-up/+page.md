### Celebrate Your Wins

The very next thing you should do is post a tweet celebrating how far you've come and flexing how much you've learnt to the community.

Go ahead and share your success on Twitter. There's no better way to share the news than a straightforward, cheerful tweet. If you're not sure how to compose your tweet, don't worry. I got you covered.

### Farcaster: Web3 Social Media

You might also be interested in a more Web3 focused social media, if so I'd recommend checking out [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) to find like-minded researches and connect!

### CodeHawks First Flights

With two practice audits under your belt, I highly recommend participating in a [**CodeHawks First Flight**](https://www.codehawks.com/first-flights). These events are made specifically for someone like you, someone who wants to get their feet wet with easier/quicker competitive audits and gain some real experience.

.. If you're feeling really confident, you may even want to try a _real_ competitive audit!

Now's a great time to pause the course and participate in whichever First Flight is active, a new one starts every 2 weeks!

### Commend Yourself for The Milestone Achieved

Regardless of what you choose to do next, take a moment to pat yourself on the back. You've made it this far and it's no small feat. You've gotten a feel for what it's like to be a security researcher‚Äîdiving into code bases, writing reports, looking for vulnerabilities, and spotting potential bugs based on past experiences.

Remember, in this field, repetition is the mother of skill. The more audits you carry out, the more skilled you will become.

```js
console.log(
  "Congratulations on getting this far! Now, go enjoy some ice cream."
);
```

Take that break, because in Section 5 the training wheels come off with `TSwap`, we're going to jump into Invariants, Fuzzing, Advanced DeFi and more.

Congratulations again, and I'll see you in Section 5!
