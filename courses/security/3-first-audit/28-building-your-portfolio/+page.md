# Building an Audit Report Portfolio with GitHub

If you're looking to establish yourself as a credible smart contract auditor or simply a coding maven in security, having an organized and accessible portfolio of your audit reports can be a game-changer. Whether they're your latest software Security Reviews or faith-inspiring Code Hawk Learnings, these reports can narrate your journey and expertise, and impress potential clients or employers.

In this article, we'll be talking about how to compile your portfolio on GitHub and at the end of this, you'll have your first portfolio ready to charm the world! So let's jump straight in.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository

We begin by creating a new repository in your profile. You can name this repository anything that suits the narrative of your work - "My Audit Reports", "Security Reviews", "Updraft Portfolio", etc. We decide to name our repository "Codehawks Security Portfolio".

Here's how you create a new repository:

## Step 2: Adding an Existing File

Scroll down to the Git setup page and click on “upload an existing file”. If you're using a Mac, you can easily reveal hidden finder by right-clicking and choosing 'Reveal in Finder'. Of course, Windows users can find their own methods to navigate to the file explorer.

We are essentially looking to add our PDF reports here. I’ll take an example report and add it to the repository.

This could, in turn, allow you (and others) to effortlessly trace your progression.\*

Adding the renamed report to the repository is as simple as copying it and pasting it back into the repository folder in your finder.

## Step 3: Committing Your Changes

Once the report is added, you'll need to confirm your changes by 'committing' them. Click the `commit` button at the base of the screen to save the changes.

## Step 4: Building On Your Portfolio

Now the important figurative brick has been laid. You can continue building up by adding your reports as and when they come in. You can create a README file later to guide the repository visitors through what they can find and expect from this repository.

By clicking the link of your portfolio, now anyone can delve into your journey, witness the work you have accomplished, and instill trust in your abilities as a smart contract auditor or a security specialist. You can now use these repositories to display your portfolio to the world.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your first portfolio using Github. It's a huge milestone and now with this achievement, you are ready to showcase your work, experiences, and skills to the world. Keep this portfolio updated and it's only going to impress potential clients and employers and skyrocket your chances in landing that dream opportunity.
