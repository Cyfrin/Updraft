## Embracing Your Role as a Security Researcher

First and foremost, you are not just coders or developers - you are security researchers. You are the gatekeepers ensuring the integrity of smart contracts. A mere [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) linkâ•® does not guarantee the maturity of any codebase. Our goal is to ensure that these protocols are not only safe and secure but also well-documented and supported with a robust test suite.

> "Smart contracts are the most adversarial environment on the planet, and we need to treat them as such."

If you are handed a code base within a smart contract development framework, yet find it lacking adequate tests or documentation, remember, this isn't going to be helpful. Our job often involves dealing with business logic bugs - understanding what the codebase does is crucial.

As much as we need more information from protocol developers, sometimes, it falls upon us, the security researchers, to educate them about the best security practices.

## Scoping Out a Codebase

Wondering where to start? We provide you with a minimal onboarding form to begin your client interaction. This form facilitates your understanding of the fundamentals required for scoping out a codebase.

As you gain more experience, an extended onboarding form will be introduced. Let's not jump ahead though; we'll touch on this more in future sessions.

With our final security review code base, you have the answer key to all the bugs within the system. A final onboarded test suite (final security review v3) is available at your disposal.

You can customize the onboarding form based on your preferences. In competitive audits, you'll find the form already filled out for you. This form is the basic blueprint of what you'll need the codebase to be like.

## Information - Your Key to a Successful Security Review

For a fruitful security review, obtaining thorough knowledge is critical. You should know

1. How to clone the codebase
2. How to build it
3. How to test it

More than this, you'll need the exact commit hash, the precise files, and the scope with which you'll be working, as well as the Solidity version (Solc) and the chains involved.

Thus, your primary mission is to hunt down information.

```
The steps involved in a security review:- Cloning the codebase- Building it- Testing it- Knowing the commit hash- Identifying the files and scope.- Understanding the Solc version and chains involved.
```

## Congratulatory Note and a Sneak Peek

A huge congratulations on reaching this far! I know the journey might seem verbose and daunting, but trust me, all these painstaking steps are crucial. They will save you hours in the future, especially if you consider becoming an independent auditor or starting your firm.

Whether or not you opt for a competitive audit, understanding these essentials will fortify your strategy for handling future security situations.

Stay tuned! The course has a lot more in store for you, as we will discuss different practices and insights key to your growth as a successful security researcher. Let's soldier on toward becoming the best guardians of the digital realm!
