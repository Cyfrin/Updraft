### What comes next?

Alright, we've made significant progress already. Reflecting on our development journey, we have notched up three substantial findings which are currently in our repository. However, our to-do list isn't finished yet. We still have two crucial aspects to iron out.

First, our three findings need to be appended with their respective severity ratings. We're going to look into how best to determine a findings severity and adjust our report to reflect these assessments.

Secondly, we need to convert our `findings.md` - a markdown file - into a professional-looking PDF that can be shared with protocols, and showcased on our portfolio. The PDF's we'll be creating are visible on the course's [**GitHub Repo**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/3-passwordstore-audit/blob/audit-data/audit-data/report.pdf), so check them out.

Let's get started with `determining a finding's severity`.
