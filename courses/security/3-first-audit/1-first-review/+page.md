Welcome everyone! I hope you're well-rested, rehydrated, and ready to dive into the nitty-gritty of how smart contract audits work. We've had a good start with a high-level overview of what a smart contract audit or a security review contains. Now, we're going to go a level further by conducting not one, but a handful of audits from sections 3 to 8.

This is an exciting journey to improve our understanding of audits. We'll strengthen our knowledge and learn from some of the best people in the world such as Hans, the number one competitive auditor in the world for the first half of 2023. Now let’s kick things off with the Password Store audit.

## The Password Store Audit: A Closer Look

For today's adventure, we're immersing ourselves into a scenario where we'll perform our own private audit, just like you could if you were working for a firm like Cyfrin IO. It's a very immersive and experiential way of learning as we'll virtually submit a request for an audit, engage in the inbound process, and review the audit in detail.

## What’s the Catch?

Now, don't be fooled. We’ve picked a shorter codebase with minimal bugs for this exercise - one with less than 20 lines of code in fact, making it easier to understand at this stage. But remember, being a security expert means finding quirks where others might not see them.

This process might not be as straightforward as it seems, as clients often lack the knowledge and expertise that you bring. Thus, it is crucial that we don’t miss out on any bugs and threats.

## Remember the Phases

It’s important to remember the phases for each audit or security review. They include:

- Initial review
- Protocol fixes
- Mitigation review

In this course, our main focus will primarily be on the initial review. After the protocol fixes the identified bugs in the code base, the initial review is usually repeated, sans the scoping, which has already been done.

Having this strategy helps to keep our goals organized and in focus.

So, with the expectations set and our targets defined, let's move ahead and commence our very first smart contract audit or security review. We'll start off with a scenario that will help us better understand what our roles as auditors will look like.
