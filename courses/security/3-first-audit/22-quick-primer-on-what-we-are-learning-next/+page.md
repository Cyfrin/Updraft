# Converting Markdown Files to Professional Documents and Adding Severity

## Ratings: A Complete Guide

Alright folks, we've made significant progress already. Reflecting on our development journey, we have notched up three substantial findings which are currently in our repository. However, our to-do list isn't finished yet. We still have two crucial aspects to iron out: first, our three findings need to be appended with their respective severity ratings, and secondly, we need to convert our Findings MD - a markdown file to a professional-looking PDF that can be shared with protocols, community, and others.

## Why Converting Markdown to Professional PDFs and Severity Ratings Matter?

As developers, markdown files are a piece of cake for us, but we can't presumptuously assume the same for everyone else. Some people may not find them as digestible, hence the necessity to convert these findings into a PDF file or a more standardized looking document. Another advantage of housing this professional-looking PDF file is that we can showcase it on our GitHub, contributing to our portfolio of projects we've audited.

And let's not forget about severity ratings. It serves as a measure to gauge the gravity of our findings - a crucial aspect that we haven't attended yet.

In short, our work will remain incomplete until these final two tasks are accomplished. To make your quest easier, both tasks are covered under this audit data branch of the GitHub repository associated with this course.

## How to Make A Professional Looking PDF and Define Severities?

By following the guide provided, you can convert your markdown file into a polished PDF that provides a more congenial read for your protocols during a private audit.

Moreover, the course also covers how to define Severities for codehox, competitive audits, and private audits. Upon wrapping up these two tasks, your section is as good as done!

However, you wonâ€™t be left in the lurch. Rest assured, a refresher is on its way. Now, let's dive into the concept of Severity Rating!"

## The Final Stretch: Severity Rating

Stay tuned as we delve further into this crucial aspect of the Severity Rating. Together, let's unravel the journey of transforming a straightforward markdown file into a sophisticated PDF and assessing the severity of our findings effectively. No more waiting; let's get to it!
