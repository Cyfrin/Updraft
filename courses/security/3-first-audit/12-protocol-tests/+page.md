As security researchers our job is to ultimately do what's necessary to make a protocol more secure. While we've thoroughly examined everything within scope of `PasswordStore` there can be some value in expanding our recon.

Test suites should be an expectation of any protocol serious about security, assuring adequate test coverage will be valuable in a `private audit`.

## Testing and Coverage

Anyone at this stage of the course should be familiar with how to check the `test coverage` of a repo.

```bash
forge build
forge test
```

The above will run all current tests, to check `coverage` we'll use:

```bash
forge coverage
```

Wow! Our coverage looks great...right? It's important to note that coverage may be a vanity metric and not truly representative of what's being tested for. If we look closely at the tests included, we can see the a major vulnerability we found (`Access Control`) wasn't tested for at all.

```js
function test_owner_can_set_password() public {
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
    passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);
    string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
    assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
}

function test_non_owner_reading_password_reverts() public {
    vm.startPrank(address(1));

    vm.expectRevert(PasswordStore.PasswordStore__NotOwner.selector);
    passwordStore.getPassword();
}
```

In addition to the above, tests aren't going to catch problems with documentation, or erroneous business logic. It's important not to assume things are fine because our framework tells us so.

### Wrap Up

We're really progressing through this process well and we're ready to write a report for each of our findings. We'll cover this in our next lesson!
