# Congratulations on Nailing Part One of the Security Curriculum: Here's What's Next

Hey, friends. Great to see you again. What a journey it's been so far!

Getting through the first part of this majorly intense curriculum deserves a massive round of applause. We've covered a variety of crucial topics. From `Mev signature replays` and `reentrancy attacks`, we've gone over the `audit process`, to `stateful fuzzing`. We've also touched on interesting concepts like `invariants`, `arbitrage`, `DeFi`, `borrowing and lending`, `flash loans`, and much more.

In just completing the last five security reviews, you've not only established a formidable portfolio but also demonstrated that persistent practice pays off. Remember: repetition is the mother of skill.


## You got this

And here is the thing, we've just trained you on the EXACT process the professionals do. So you know how to do this!!

## The Game Plan

**1. Scoping**

Begin with scope identification. Determine what you're working with - the commit hash, the compatibilities, the chains, and the tokens.

**2. High-Level Analysis**

Next, aim to understand what the code is supposed to achieve. Read the documentation, discuss with the team, make diagrams, take notes. Dump all your thoughts down on paper.

**3. Code Comprehension**

Time to dive into the code. It’s okay if you don’t find anything at first – that's normal. Simply aim to interpret the code. Ask yourself: Is the code doing what the protocol intends it to do?

**4. Identifying Vulnerabilities**

Your final mission is the most challenging - finding vulnerabilities. Use your checklist for guidance, looking for any weird ERC20s or potential MEV.

## Testing Your Skills

The Vault Guardians code base offers greater complexity than any previous codebases. Embrace this new level of difficulty. Seize this opportunity to test your prowess in the face of adversity.

My suggestion to you: team up with a peer. This vault presents numerous bugs and issues for you to uncover, which will help build your confidence and improve your bug-finding skills.

**And remember: do not proceed to part two just yet.**

## A Valuable Detour

Now, it's time. You have 2 options. 

\**Option 1: Compete in a real competitive audit on platforms like Code Hawks. The excitement of the competition will keep you on edge and the real code base is sure to test all your abilities*.

\*\*Option 2: Pair up and tackle the Vault Guardians codebase as a learning experience.

## To Recap:

1. First of all, great job! By just getting this far, you outdo more than 70% of the current security landscape.
2. Do not move to part two yet. Either try your hand at a Code Hawks competitive audit or complete the Vault Guardians audit with a partner.

Remember your security journey is far from over. Part two is where we (will) dig even deeper into assembly, EVM, formal verification, and more. 

So... We are looking forward to seeing you back for Part 2 after you try your hand at either Vault Guardians or Code Hawks.

Good luck!!
