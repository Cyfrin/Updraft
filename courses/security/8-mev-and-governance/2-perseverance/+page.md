### Why is this Section 7.5?

Originally Section 8 was designed to act as our final boss. I was going to have us perform a security review on an absolutely massive code base - [**Vault Guardians**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/8-vault-guardians-audit). We're talking 800 nSLOC.

Eventually, you _will_ need to possess the confidence to stand up to a codebase like this without guidance. You need to get good at feeling potentially overwhelmed and knowing you will persevere anyway, having a plan to tackle the problem, no matter how big it is.

So, I've split things up a bit. In section 7.5 we're going to cover the attack vectors you'll see in Vault Guardians and detail the kinds of exploits you can expect. When we're done, it'll be up to you to defeat the final boss yourself.

### Work Together

Securing Web3 isn't a one man/woman job. Collaboration and working together is a huge part of this ecosystem and I encourage you to not go it alone. Reach out to fellow researchers [**in the community**](https://discord.gg/cyfrin), partner up and take out Vault Guardians together!

As always, there'll be an audit-data branch of the Vault Guardians repo to compare your results to.

### Wrap Up

So... To recap.

We are going over some exploits in this section, in particular:

- MEV
- Governance Attacks

And then, to finish part 1 of the security course, your goal will be to:

1.  Audit Vault Guardians
2.  Participate in a [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) competitive audit

Let's get started!
