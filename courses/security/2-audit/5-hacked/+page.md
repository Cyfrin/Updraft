# Penetrating the Scenario: What If Your Security Audit Fails?

As the world moves towards a more digital infrastructure, the importance of security audits cannot be overstated. But who carries the blame when these audits fail? Should it always land at the feet of those responsible for conducting the audit?

While broaching upon this intricate subject, I recently had a pleasant chat with a fellow security researcher, Tincho, who imparted an inspiring perspective. He offers valuable insights on the way we should perceive the role and responsibilities of auditors in these precarious scenarios. Think of it as your handy guide to navigating through the messed-up aftermath of a security audit gone wrong.

## Redefining the Role of Auditors

In the eyes of many, the fundamental purpose of a security audit is to identify and rectify the most critical vulnerabilities in a system. However, Tincho encourages us to look beyond this simplistic view.

> Auditors should provide value, regardless of whether or not they spot critical issues.

In other words, an auditor's value doesn't solely rest upon their ability to find existing flaws. Instead, their advises should strengthen the overall security protocol and offer pragmatic solutions for future scenarios.

A successful auditor should solidify his reputation based on the efficacy of the overall system rather than isolated cases of critical incidents. The ultimate goal should always be to bolster Ethereum's security rather than simply mitigating immediate threats.

## Who Owns the Blame?

The notion of finding a scapegoat when a system is exploited is a regressive one.

> Many factors could lead to the successful exploitation of a vulnerability.

Attributing the failure of a system to an auditor's incompetency is simplistic and misguided. If a vulnerability was missed, it means it slipped past numerous stages of checks and balances, of which an audit is just one. When a flaw goes unnoticed for as long as four months, there are perhaps lapses in system monitoring and in many other security parameters.

## The Auditorâ€™s Role in the Wake of a Breach

So, what should an auditor do if a protocol they've reviewed ends up compromised? The answer is that a responsible security partner should not abandon their client in the midst of a crisis.

As an auditor, your role is to help mitigate the damage, restrict the scope of the attack, and possibly identify the hackers. A quality auditor must be there, lending their expertise, during the inevitable chaos that ensues after a breach.

> Your responsibilities to the client are outlined in the agreement that you initially signed. However, to be a trusted partner and maintain a good relationship, you will need to go above and beyond in assisting them in whatever scenario arises.

## Conclusion

While 100% secure systems may be the ultimate goal, it is also a journey. It was great catching up with Tincho whose outlook on security audits balances realism with the optimistic pursuit of improvement. He perfectly encapsulates that the blame game is counterproductive. Instead, every party involved in a security protocol must work together as a team and learn from any failure to ensure a safer, more secure digital environment.
