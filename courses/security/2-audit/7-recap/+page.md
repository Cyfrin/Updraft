## The Basics of Smart Contract Audits

A smart contract audit is essentially a timed, extensive examination, targeting possible security vulnerabilities within a smart contract. But why is it vital?

Well, its main function is to ensure that a protocol is as shielded and invulnerable as possible. It's like drawing a hero's map to the treasures of security. Any detected bugs, vulnerabilities, or inefficiencies are noted and suggested fixes, enhancements, or optimizations provided.

However, we must accept that there's no one ultimate solution to auditing or conducting security reviews. So, there's absolutely "no silver bullet," as we may say. It's not a one-size-fits-all scenario. The process is unique for each piece of code and requires custom examination depending on its specific function and architecture.

## The Fundamentals of a Security Review

Generally, a security review is divided into three crucial stages:

1. Initial review: This phase involves drafting the scope and engaging in reconnaissance.
2. Write up vulnerabilities: All vulnerabilities are documented in detail.
3. Protocol fixes: At this stage, the flaws are tackled, and verification is conducted to affirm if the fixes work perfectly.

Keep in mind that ensuring security isnâ€™t only a crucial point in the smart contract development lifecycle, it's a continuous, never-ending process!

Thinking about post-deployment planning, monitoring and maintaining is just as important as the development itself.

## Tooling for Security Review

In future posts, we'll be delving into the various tools utilized in conducting security reviews. Trust me, you'll need to get your hands dirty with resources like static analysis, Slither, Adarin, invariant tests and fuzzing form of verification, AI, etc.

Before any project undergoes an audit, it should ideally comply with a safety checklist or preferably, the rect test 100%. Why? Because, as security researchers, we need to be continually learning and evolve.

Always remember, be it in 2023, 2024, or 2025, the key is to keep mastering the top attack vectors.

## Learning from the Past to Secure the Future

Let's briefly touch on some of the top attacks that took place in 2023, and probably, would recur in the years to come. Take reentrancy, for instance. Since 2016, this issue has lingered, hitting time and again. But there's hope.

Through this course, our aim is to drop that number to zero! A drop in reentrancy issues to zero, in 2024! An ambitious goal, you say? But one that we must strive for because no one deserves to fall victim to these malicious hacks.

Let's bet on improving the security of the crypto ecosystem by starting with your own smart contract, are you ready?
