### Introduction

Welcome to Part 2..ish of the smart contract security course. In this course, I will be teaching the best practices for working with smart contracts and private keys. The call to action for this course will be somewhat different from all other courses on `Cyfrin Updraft`. By the end of previous courses the goal is to empower you to take next steps, to become an engineer/auditor. The goal here is really to level you up, we want to give you the knowledge necessary to do what you do _`better`_ and more _`safely`_ from the perspective of post-deployment and wallet management.

By the end of this course, you will have a great understanding of the details you should keep in mind when developing a `real protocol` or helping to secure one. The course content includes working with wallets and cloud infrastructure, different monitoring and blockchain sleuthing solutions, understanding bug bounties, white hatting and black hatting, and most importantly, how to react in a situation where you are hacked. Knowing what to do in such situations ensures your survival and helps you make the best possible decisions.

You will engage in some drilling exercises in this course, which will make it quicker and slightly different from my other content. I highly encourage you to take notes, follow along with the exercises, pace yourself, have fun, and remember to treat yourself to a cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è or ice cream üç¶ when needed. Let's get started!
