## Advanced Blockchain Explorers

When standard block explorers like Etherscan fall short, advanced tools like Openchain, Phalcon, and Tenderly provide deeper insights into blockchain transactions.

### Openchain: The Transaction Tracer

Openchain allows you to paste a transaction hash into their transaction tracer, providing detailed call traces that include:

- Function selectors
- Calls executed by the smart contract
- Return values

This tool is essential for conducting post-mortem analyses by revealing detailed transaction flows.

### Phalcon: Detailed Transaction Analysis

Phalcon offers similar functionality to Openchain, providing comprehensive data including:

- Basic transaction information
- Fund flow analysis
- Call traces
- Event logs

Phalcon systematically explains each action taken in a transaction.

### Tenderly: Comprehensive Blockchain Analysis

Tenderly goes beyond basic transaction tracing by offering:

- Transaction previews
- War rooms for issue management
- Real-time monitoring and analytics
- Transaction simulations

Tenderly allows for interactive and forward-looking transaction analysis.

## Enhancing Etherscan with MetaDoc

MetaDoc is a browser extension that enhances Etherscan with features such as:

- "Explain with GPT" for transaction analysis
- Direct links to Openchain, Phalcon, and Tenderly
- Advanced risk analysis and fund flow visualizations

MetaDoc transforms Etherscan into a more powerful tool for blockchain analysis.

## Dune Analytics: SQL-Based Blockchain Querying

Dune Analytics is a powerful tool for those familiar with SQL, allowing you to:

- Query blockchain data with SQL statements
- Identify smart contract vulnerabilities by searching for specific bytecode patterns

Dune Analytics is invaluable for in-depth blockchain data analysis.

## Emerging Tools: Ghost Logs and Shadow Logs

Ghost Logs and Shadow Logs provide custom event emission, enhancing the monitoring capabilities of smart contracts. These tools allow for more detailed logging and monitoring of contract interactions.

## Why These Tools Matter

For professional post-mortem analyses and hack investigations, tools like Openchain, Phalcon, and Tenderly are indispensable. They provide the detailed insights necessary for understanding and addressing blockchain vulnerabilities.

Familiarize yourself with these tools to enhance your ability to investigate and analyze blockchain transactions effectively. With these advanced tools, you can navigate the complexities of blockchain data and uncover the full story behind each transaction.

Equip yourself with these tools and embrace the role of a blockchain detective. Whether for security audits or transaction analyses, these resources are essential for anyone working with blockchain technology.
