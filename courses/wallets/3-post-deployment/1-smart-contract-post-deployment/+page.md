### Introduction

Welcome to the post-deployment section of the security course. This part will provide a high-level overview of the essential steps you should take before, during, and after deploying your project on the blockchain. Additionally, we will discuss the best practices for preparing for worst-case scenarios.

If you're following along with the GitHub repository associated with this lesson, this content corresponds to Section 2. In this section, we will explore how to secure a project post-deployment from the perspectives of both protocol developers and security researchers.

### Objectives

From a protocol developer's perspective, we'll cover:

- Post-deployment security practices to ensure your project remains safe.
- Establishing security contacts, bug bounties, and safe harbor policies to facilitate responsible disclosure.
- The importance of monitoring and its role in mitigating hacks.
- Running disaster recovery drills to prepare for high-pressure scenarios.

From a security researcher's perspective, we'll discuss:

- The importance of responsible disclosure and avoiding the exploitation of smart contracts.
- Familiarization with various tools, bug bounties, and blockchain analysis techniques.

### Summary and Resources

### Key Takeaways for Protocol Developers

1. **Establish a Security Contact:** Ensure there is a clear way for security researchers to reach out if they discover an issue.
2. **Implement Bug Bounties and Safe Harbor:** These incentives encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.
3. **Prioritize Monitoring:** Regular monitoring is crucial to detect hacks promptly and mitigate their impact.
4. **Run Disaster Recovery Drills:** Practice responding to potential disasters to prepare for high-pressure scenarios.

### Key Takeaways for Security Researchers

1. **Responsible Disclosure:** Always reach out to the protocol's team first if you discover a vulnerability.
2. **Familiarize with Tools:** Learn to use various blockchain analysis tools and participate in bug bounty programs.
3. **Stay Informed:** Keep up with the latest developments in DeFi security.

### Recommended Viewing

To kick off this section, watch the DeFi Summit 2023 video: [DeFi Summit 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&v=jSpvDhuaCgc). This event took place approximately eight months ago and features a comprehensive overview by Peter, who runs the Block Threat Intelligence newsletter. Peter's talk covers the current state of security in DeFi and highlights the importance of the topics we will discuss, including post-deployment practices and monitoring.

### Conclusion

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of post-deployment security practices for smart contracts. This knowledge will help you ensure your project remains secure and resilient against potential threats.
