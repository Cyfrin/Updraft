### Introduction to Incident Response

Welcome back! You've learned a lot about setting up security policies, monitoring, and even building your own Forta bot. Now, let's focus on incident responseâ€”what to do when something goes wrong.

### Preparing for Incidents

Having a robust incident response plan is crucial. Here are key steps to ensure you're prepared:

1. **Disaster Recovery Drills**: Regularly conduct drills to practice handling incidents. This helps your team stay calm and collected during actual crises.
2. **War Rooms**: Participate in war rooms where developers and security researchers come together to handle hacking events. Seal offers a war room practice in beta. Sign up [here](https://form.typeform.com/to/jJoH2ktE?typeform-source=securityalliance.org).
3. **Live Scenario Documentation**: Refer to the Seal drill documentation [here](https://securityalliance.notion.site/Live-Scenario-Documentation-520e7db48e2143f7bc41b729fb219996) for practicing incident response.

### Tools and Resources

- **Seal 911 Bot**: Contact the Seal 911 bot on Telegram [here](https://t.me/seal_911_bot) if you discover a vulnerability or need immediate assistance. They act as smart contract firefighters.
- **Bug Bounty Platforms**: Utilize bug bounty platforms for reporting live code bugs. These platforms handle the entire disclosure process, ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.

### Conducting Post-Mortems

After an incident, conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future. This process is essential for improving your incident response strategy.

### Recommendations

1. **Run Mock Scenarios**: Before deployment, simulate potential issues to see how quickly your team can resolve them.
2. **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on updates from Cyfrin Updraft for new walkthroughs on Seal drills, war games, and disaster recovery scenarios.

### Conclusion

Experience in handling incidents is invaluable. By practicing in a controlled environment, you'll be better prepared to respond to real threats calmly and effectively. Bug bounties are an integral part of security disclosure, and leveraging these platforms ensures a structured approach to vulnerability management.
