### Introduction to Forta Bot

In this lesson, we will guide you through creating your own Forta Bot. Forta is a network designed to scan blockchains and listen for specific alerts, enabling you to build and deploy bots to this network.

### What is Forta?

Forta is a decentralized network for monitoring blockchain activity and detecting malicious transactions. You can develop and deploy bots to the Forta network, effectively creating a "bot chain." Learn more about Forta in their [documentation](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/intro-to-bot-dev/).

### Building Your Forta Bot

This tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42RcaQ8YTzQ) will walk you through the process of creating a Forta Bot. You will learn how to:

- Write and deploy your own monitoring scripts
- Detect and respond to malicious transactions
- Understand the key considerations when building monitoring systems

### Why Use Forta?

By creating a Forta Bot, you gain the ability to monitor blockchain activity independently. This tutorial will equip you with the knowledge to manage and respond to potential threats effectively.
