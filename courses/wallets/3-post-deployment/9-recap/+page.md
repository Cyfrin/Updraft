### Summary of Key Points

In this section, we covered essential theoretical aspects of deploying a protocol and acting as a white hat. Here's a quick review of what we learned:

#### For Protocol Developers

1. **Security Contact/Bug Bounty/Safe Harbor**:

   - Ensure you have a designated security contact, bug bounty program, and safe harbor agreement in place before deployment.

2. **Pre-deployment Monitoring**:

   - Set up monitoring mechanisms to keep track of your protocol’s activity before deployment. Use tools like OpenZeppelin Defender or custom solutions.

3. **Disaster Recovery Drill**:
   - Conduct disaster recovery drills to prepare for potential incidents. Practice handling difficult scenarios to ensure smooth incident management.

#### For Security Researchers

1. **Do Not Exploit Smart Contracts**:

   - Never exploit a smart contract without coordinating with the responsible team, even if you have good intentions. The only exception might be front-running a transaction already in the mempool.

2. **Responsible Disclosure**:

   - Familiarize yourself with responsible disclosure practices to handle vulnerabilities ethically and effectively.

3. **Tooling and Platforms**:
   - Get acquainted with bug bounty platforms and blockchain sleuthing tools to aid in vulnerability discovery and disclosure.

### Protocol Security Measures

- **Establish Security Contacts and Policies**:

  - Set up clear security contacts and policies before deployment. This includes bug bounties, security patches, advisories, and safe harbor agreements.

- **Implement Monitoring Systems**:

  - Utilize Python scripts, open-source tools, or platforms like Chaos Lab to monitor your protocol’s health and simulate economic situations.

- **Incident Response Practice**:
  - Regularly practice incident response scenarios to ensure your team is prepared for real incidents. Consider setting up a bug bounty platform using services like Immunefi or HackerOne.

### Exercises

To solidify your understanding, walk through different types of hacks and compare the approaches of black hats, white hats, and no hats. Analyze the scenarios to identify potential improvements and understand the impact of various security measures.

1. **Study Famous Hacks**:

   - Review at least three well-known hacks to understand the attacks and defenses involved. Write a blog post or conduct a detailed analysis to deepen your knowledge.

2. **Conduct Post-Mortems**:
   - Perform post-mortem analyses on hacks to learn from past incidents. Try writing proof of code for some attacks to enhance your practical skills.

### Moving Forward

You've completed the wallet and post-deployment section of the course. While this part involved a lot of reading and theoretical knowledge, it has equipped you with critical insights into security practices.

Take a break and prepare for the next section, where we will delve into assembly, EVM opcode, and formal verification. This will elevate your understanding of smart contracts and security to an expert level.

Great job so far, and I look forward to continuing this journey with you as we tackle more advanced topics in smart contract security.
