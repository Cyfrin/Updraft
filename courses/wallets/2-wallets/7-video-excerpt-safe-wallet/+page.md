### Introduction to Safe Wallet

"Safe." A term that might make you cautious about the crypto project it's associated with, except when it is preceded by the word "Gnosis."

**Gnosis Safe**, now commonly referred to as just **Safe**, is the most popular programmable smart contract wallet. It is renowned for its multi-signature capabilities and customization options, unlike traditional wallets, also known as externally owned accounts (EOAs).

### Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)

Externally owned accounts are wallets secured by a single private key. Examples of such wallets include Metamask, Ledger, and Rainbow. If you lose or expose this single private key, your funds are at risk of being lost. Additionally, some of these wallets might have closed-source code, making it difficult to guarantee their security.

### Smart Contract Accounts

In contrast, a smart contract account (or wallet) is controlled by open-source code. These accounts offer enhanced security and customization, such as requiring multiple keys to sign a transaction (multi-signature or multi-sig wallets). If one private key in a 2-out-of-3 multi-sig wallet is exposed, it cannot alone initiate a transaction, and the exposed key can be replaced.

### Gnosis Safe: The Leading Multi-Sig Wallet

Gnosis Safe is the most popular multi-sig wallet, trusted by protocols like Aave, Synthetix, and many others. Hereâ€™s how to get started with your own Safe wallet:

1. Visit [Safe](https://app.safe.global/welcome) and click on 'Create New Safe'.
2. Connect at least one private key of your choice.
3. Complete the 'Confirmation Creation' process to deploy your Safe.

Once deployed, you can:

- Copy the address of your Safe smart contract wallet.
- Send funds from your externally owned account to your Safe.
- Manage transactions within the Safe UI, ensuring that the required number of signers approve each transaction.

### Customization and Extensions

Safe wallets are highly customizable. You can extend your Safe with modules and guards to enhance its functionality and security further.

### Why Use Safe?

Safe multi-sig wallets are used by some of the largest DeFi protocols. They offer robust security measures, ensuring that if one key is compromised, it can be swiftly replaced without risking your funds.

### Analytics and Popularity

According to [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards), Safe wallets are the most popular one-of-one multi-sig solutions available.
