Social recovery wallets are an excellent option for advanced users, providing a balance of security and convenience similar to multi-signature wallets. This type of wallet is particularly favored by Vitalik Buterin, one of the leading figures in the cryptocurrency space.

### How Social Recovery Wallets Work

A social recovery wallet operates with a single private key used to sign transactions. Additionally, it involves a set of at least three guardians who can collectively change the signing key if necessary. This system combines the simplicity of a single-signature wallet with the added security of multiple guardians.

> "Under all normal circumstances, the user can simply use their social recovery wallet like a regular wallet, signing messages with their signing key so that each transaction signed can proceed with a single confirmation click, much like it would in a traditional wallet like Metamask.
>
> If they lose the private key used to sign transactions, that is when the social-recovery functionality kicks in."

### Addressing Security Concerns

You might worry about whether your guardians could access your wallet. This is where a 'Shamir' backup comes into play. A Shamir backup splits your private key into several parts, giving each guardian only a share of the key. This way, no single guardian has access to the full private key, ensuring your security.

**Example:** The Trezor T hardware wallet includes this 'Shamir' backup feature, making it an excellent choice for those who want a social recovery option.
