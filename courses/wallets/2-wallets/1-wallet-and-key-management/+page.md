### Wallets And Key Managements

The Cyfrin Web3 Wallet Guide article `https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/best-web3-wallets-safest-way-to-store-crypto` provides valuable information on different types of wallets and their trade-offs. It is a high-level guide that can be used by both developers and protocols. The article offers an unbiased opinion as it is not sponsored by any wallets currently.

When choosing a wallet solution, it is important to consider the following:

- **Threat Vectors:** Assess the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with the wallet.
- **Key Considerations:** Determine what factors are important to you and your specific needs.
- **Target Audience:** Identify who the wallet is intended for and their requirements.
- **Wallet Control:** Understand what assets or functionalities the wallet will be managing.

It is recommended to ask yourself these questions before deploying your smart contract to ensure you make an informed decision.

### Beginners

For total beginners who are unfamiliar with cryptographic signatures, public and private keys, and are unsure about managing and securing their private keys, a recommended solution is to use a custodial wallet. `Custodial wallets` are similar to exchanges such as `Coinbase`, `Binance`, `Kraken`, and even `PayPal`. Here are some pros and cons of using a custodial wallet:

Pros:

- Easy to use
- Outsourcing security responsibility to the exchange
- Trusting the chosen exchange with wallet security

Cons:

- Risk of rug pulls, where the exchange may deceive users about the safety of their funds
- Possibility of the exchange freezing funds or denying access to them
- The exchange technically owns the funds, not the user
- Doesn't work with Web3 apps

Using a custodial wallet can be seen as a first step towards entering the Web3 space, but it's important to remember that the crypto stored in these wallets is not truly owned by the user. Exchanges like `Binance`, `Kraken`, `Coinbase`, and `PayPal` have control over the private keys and can deny access to the funds. While using custodial wallets is not advisable for those who are well-versed in web3 technology, it may be a suitable approach for individuals who are new to the technology and lack understanding.

> ❗ **IMPORTANT**
> I highly encourage people to advance past the beginner stage and educate themselves enough to be comfortable with self-custodial situations.

### Wrap Up

Because you're here, I know you're not a noob, but in this lesson we've outlined some solutions you can suggest to your friends to keep them safe as they grow into Web3 themselves.

If someone is unfamiliar with how things work in this space, outsourcing security to those that do may be the best choice.
