### Hardware Wallets

Moving up in security, as mentioned in the last lesson, we hit Hardware Wallets. These enjoy all the same benefits as a browser style wallet, while having additional security layers. Let's go into more detail.

Hardware Wallets come with some pros and cons:

Pros:

- more secure that hot wallets
- self custodial
- "airgapped", unplugged someone would need access to the wallet to access the funds
- Good for small/medium amounts of money

Cons:

- cost money and can sometimes be expensive
- aren't fool proof
- it's more difficult to interact with dapps
- vulnerable to "wrench attacks" or physical attack for access to your funds
- vulnerable to supply chain attacks, swapped wallets, maliciously updated software etc

Hardware wallets are more ideal for longer term storage of value.

Many claim that hardware wallets are _good enough_, and to that I disagree, doubly so for protocol developers.

There's a phenomenal [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9y-KQbqi4) from Joe Grand detailing how he hacked into a hardware wallet to recover $2 million. I highly recommend you check it out, great watch.

Some suggestions to consider for a hardware wallet include:

### Wrap Up

Hardware wallets are a great investment, and a great way to increase your personal security, but be cautious.

Be sure to use trusted hardware wallet providers avoid things like tracking software, or companies with a history of randomly updating software. Some companies sell wallets the private keys of which are held _on their servers_. This is gross, do your research!

And finally, it's a wallet, it's not jewelry. be skeptical of companies encouraging you to wear them about. This shows a clear misunderstanding of security best practices.
