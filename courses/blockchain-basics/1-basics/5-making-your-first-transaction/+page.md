## Setting up Metamask for Ethereum Transactions

In this section, we will learn how to make a transaction on a test Ethereum blockchain using Metamask, a popular cryptocurrency wallet.

### Visiting Ethereum Website

- Go to the Ethereum website [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org).

### Understanding Blockchains

- We will make our first transaction on a test Ethereum blockchain.
- This process works the same across all EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains and layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Ethereum, ZK Sync, etc.
- EVM compatibility will be explained later.

### Setting up Metamask Wallet

1. To send a transaction on EVM chains, set up a wallet. We'll use Metamask as it's one of the most popular and easiest wallets.
2. Go to [Metamask](https://metamask.io).
3. Install the Metamask extension for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Brave).
4. Once installed, you’ll see the extension in the top-right corner of your browser.
5. Click "Get Started".
6. Select "Create a New Wallet".
7. Agree to help Metamask improve (optional).
8. Create a password. Make sure it’s secure.

   **Note**: This wallet will be for development purposes, so you may use a weaker password. But never put real money into this wallet. Treat it as a real wallet to familiarize yourself with good wallet safety.

### Secret Recovery Phrase (Master Key)

1. Metamask will provide you with a secret recovery phrase.
2. This is a series of 12 words generated when you first set up Metamask.
3. The phrase allows you to recover your wallet and funds if you ever lose access.
4. Secure your wallet by keeping your secret recovery phrase safe and secret. Write it down, store it in a safe deposit box, or use a secure password manager. Some even engrave their phrase on a metal plate.

   **Warning**: If anyone gets access to your secret recovery phrase, they can access and take all your funds. No one, including the Metamask team, can help you recover your wallet if you lose the phrase.

5. Select "Secure My Wallet".
6. Write down your secret recovery phrase and save it securely.
7. Confirm by re-entering your phrase.
8. Click "Got it" after creating your wallet.

### Understanding the Metamask Interface

1. You can see the interface of your Metamask wallet.
2. Pin Metamask to the top of your browser for easy access.
3. In Metamask, you can create multiple accounts. Each account has a different address.
4. All accounts created in Metamask share the same secret phrase but have different private keys.

   **Note**: Access to the secret phrase grants control to all accounts, while access to a private key only grants control to a single account.

### Selecting a Network

1. At the top-right of the Metamask interface, you’ll see “Ethereum Mainnet”.
2. Click on it to see all the networks that Metamask can access.

In this section, we have set up a Metamask wallet for development purposes and learned about the secret recovery phrase and its importance. In the next section, we will make a transaction on a test Ethereum blockchain.
