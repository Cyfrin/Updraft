### Welcome to Cyfrin Updraft!

Hello and welcome! If you're interested in the world of Web3 development, then you're in the right place. This is the most cutting edge and comprehensive course ever created.

Let's talk about what to expect.

### Why Take This Course?

With the massive demand for Solidity and Smart Contract developers, this course is a golden opportunity to launch, advance, or switch to a career in Web3. As you navigate the course, you will learn how to work with AI tools so that you can fast-track your learning journey and become a proficient `10x` developer.

Don't worry if you've never coded before, let me assure you that this course is designed for learners at all levels. If you're an experienced Smart Contract engineer or familiar with blockchain development, you're welcome to skip around and cherry-pick modules that interest you. But most importantly, this course aims to turn you into a pioneering force within Web3.

### Who Am I?

My name is Patrick Collins, a seasoned Smart Contract engineer, security researcher, and dedicated advocate for Web3. I co-founded Cyfrin, a Smart Contract Security firm, I'm an average Web3 [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/c/patrickcollins) and the co-creator of Cyfrin Updraft.

I live and breathe smart contract development.

But beyond that, I love taking passionate smart contract developers, like you, into the journey of Web3.

### What to Expect

This is not your run-of-the-mill course. Instead, it's a culmination of all the knowledge we've accumulated after years of working in this industry as a Smart Contract developers and security researchers. Our track record guarantees you'll exit the other side, armed with the knowledge necessary to make a significant impact in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.

Beyond just teaching you to code, this course prepares you to maneuver DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Tokens, Upgradeable Smart Contracts and more. By the end, you'll have a clear path forward and a wealth of economic opportunities at your disposal – all you need is the willingness to take the steps.

### Best Practices

Let's start by covering some of the best practices to help you get the absolute most out of this course.

[**Use the GitHub repo as your Bible!**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu/) it will have all the resources you'll need to succeed. Contained within, you'll find a `discussions` tab. Any questions you have or hurdles you face can be posted here!

**Ask meaningful questions and interact with like-minded learners** – this is just as important as grasping the actual technologies.

**Code along with me** - As we progress through the course, it's a good idea to code along with me. Actually _doing_ the work and performing the actions is how you'll build familiarity with these processes and how they'll really stick.

**Watch for Updates** - This space moves very quickly - as things are updated, I do my best to catalogue them. In each video, at the bottom, there will be an "updates" section if there is some information that differs from the video.

**Move at your Pace** - Adjust the pace of the course to meet your needs. The course is modular, so if you want to skip to particular areas - absolutely do that.

**Reflect on your Learnings** - repetition is the mother of skill. The more you repeat these development practices, the more they'll stick.

**Complete the Optional Challenges** - The GitHub Repo has links to fun challenges at the end of each lesson - these are meant to test your skills and reward you with a fun way to show of your progress as a smart contract developer!

**Leverage the Community** - Blockchain development is incredibly collaborative. Get involved on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23/discussions), [**Peeranha**](https://peeranha.io/) and other forums. Join our [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/cyfrin) server and have conversations with developers just like yourself.

> **Remember:** A challenge is not a roadblock, but an opportunity to learn something new.

### Let's Get Started

With the above understanding in place, get ready. We're above to embark on a journey of knowledge and opportunity.

Our first step will be understanding how the blockchain even works, what smart contracts even are.
