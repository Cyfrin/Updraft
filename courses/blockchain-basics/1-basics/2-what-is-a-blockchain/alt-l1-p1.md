# Understanding Smart Contracts: From Bitcoin to Chainlink

In this blog post, we are about to embark on an exciting journey exploring everything you need to know about blockchain technology, exploring from its foundation with **Bitcoin**, to the advent of **smart contracts**, right up to the revolutionary concepts of *hybrid smart contracts* and *decentralized oracle networks* with **Chainlink**.

## The Dawn of Blockchain: Bitcoin

You may have heard of Bitcoin - it's quite difficult not to. But in case you're unacquainted, it was among the first protocols leveraging an extraordinary technology called **blockchain**. A mysterious entity known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto generated the influential Bitcoin white paper. This outlined how Bitcoin could facilitate peer-to-peer transactions in a *decentralized network* powered by encryption and decentralization, allowing individuals to participate in censorship-resistant finance.

Those characteristics have led many people to consider Bitcoin superior to traditional value stores (such as gold). Bitcoin is often referred to as "digital gold" as it shares several properties with the precious metal, including scarcity – there's a finite quantity of Bitcoin that can be acquired or sold.

The original vision for Bitcoin is captured in the white paper, which is accessible in the GitHub repo related to this article.

What was seen as a radical breakthrough in technology has since been studied, utilized and extended by various parties hoping to bring blockchain's full potential to light.

## Introducing Ethereum and the Birth of Smart Contracts

A few years after Bitcoin, a man named Vitalik Buterin proposed a white paper for a protocol called Ethereum. Building upon Bitcoin's blockchain infrastructure, Ethereum came with an additional standout feature – **Smart Contracts**.

The project Ethereum was officially released in 2015 by Vivak Buterin and other co-founders. So what is Ethereum exactly? In a nutshell, Ethereum allows people to:

- Make decentralized transactions
- Formulate decentralized agreements
- Build decentralized organizations

..and so much more all without a centralized governing force. It's essentially a mechanism that enables people to interact with each other without any middlemen.

Smart contracts were not a new concept even then. Nick Zabo first proposed the term in 1994. Smart contracts refer to a set of instructions that are autonomously executed on a decentralized network without the need for a middleman. Their implementation on blockchain has revolutionized the way we look at agreements.

Smart contracts can be thought of like traditional contracts, a set of instructions between parties. The key difference is that they're written in code and live on decentralized blockchain platforms right where they're executed. That is what sets Ethereum apart from Bitcoin, this ability to create and execute smart contracts.

> Note: While Bitcoin has smart contracts, they are Turing incomplete by design, lacking the complete functionality of a programming language. Bitcoin developers intentionally made this decision. Bitcoin was viewed as a value store, while Ethereum was seen as a means to facilitate decentralized agreements along with being a value store.

## The Oracle Problem

One can hardly underscore the importance and transformative potential of smart contracts. But they come with one significant hurdle: if we want these digital agreements to replace our everyday contracts, they need to fetch and process data from the actual world. This is where **oracles** step in.

Blockchain can't interact with or retrieve data from external sources. They are deterministic systems designed this way with purpose. An oracle is any device that provides data to the blockchain or runs external computations. However, for maintaining true decentralization, we need a decentralized oracle network, which handles the tasks performed by individual oracles.

The harmony between on-chain decentralized logic and off-chain decentralized data/computation leads to the concept of **Hybrid Smart Contracts**. The biggest protocols we interact with today utilize or are some form of a hybrid smart contract.

Chainlink is a modular, decentralized oracle network that embodies this concept. It provides external data and computation to our smart contracts, ensuring end-to-end decentralization while extending their capability.

## Evolution of the Ecosystem: Layer 2s

Recently, a novel concept called **Layer 2** has come to the fore. A Layer 2 solution addresses scalability issues faced by blockchains. As blockchains can only grow so big, Layer 2 solutions are like extensions to the blockchain, scaling its size and capabilities. Currently, there are two primary types of true Layer 2s: Optimistic rollups and Zero knowledge rollups.

Moreover, in the coming sections, we will delve more into the mechanics of blockchains and Layer 2s, but for now, remember they primarily aim at solving scalability issues.

## Decentralized Applications (DApps)

Throughout the course of our discussion, you will encounter terms like DApps, decentralized protocol, smart contract protocol, or decentralized application. They essentially capture the same concept: **a set of smart contracts creating a decentralized application**.

Many consider these mechanisms to be part of the new era of the internet, known as *Web 3*. Unlike the previous phases, Web 1 (permissionless, open-source, static content) and Web 2 (permissioned, dynamic content), Web 3 combines the dynamic, user-driven content of Web 2 with the decentralized, user-controlled ethos of Web 1.

> At the heart of it all, Smart Contracts facilitate trust-minimized, unbreakable agreements, streamlined efficiencies, greater transparency, and more. Truly a technology as good as the problem it solves.

In following blogs, we will dive deeper into the technical aspects of these fundamental concepts from smart contracts to DApps and beyond. Stay tuned as we continue to explore the limitless potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts!
