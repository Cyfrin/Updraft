## Setting up Your Wallet

In this lesson, we'll be setting up a MetaMask wallet. MetaMask is a popular browser extension used to interact with blockchains and make transactions. 

We'll begin by searching for MetaMask in our browser. 

```javascript
metamask
```

Or, just use the [official site](https://metamask.io/).

Then, click on "Add to Brave" or "Add to Chrome."

```javascript
Add to Brave
```

MetaMask will then open a window asking us to "Get started." We'll click on "Create a new wallet."

```javascript
Create a new wallet
```

We'll be asked to create a password. Remember, this password will only unlock your MetaMask wallet on this device. MetaMask cannot recover your password. 

Next, MetaMask will ask us to secure our wallet by watching a video about the Secret Recovery Phrase. This is a series of 12 words that will allow us to recover our wallet if we ever lose access. It is important to keep this phrase safe and secret, as anyone who has access to it will be able to access all of your funds.

```javascript
Secure your wallet
```

After watching the video, click on "Secure my wallet."

```javascript
Secure my wallet
```

MetaMask will then show a series of 12 words and ask us to write them down. 

**[Tag: Include the Secret Recovery Phrase here as a list]**

We'll copy the Secret Recovery Phrase to our clipboard by clicking on "Copy to Clipboard."

```javascript
Copy to Clipboard
```

Clicking on "Next" will lead us to a page to confirm our Secret Recovery Phrase. We'll confirm this by adding the words back into the spaces provided. 

```javascript
Confirm Secret Recovery Phrase
```

Click on "Confirm" to complete the setup.

```javascript
Confirm
```

Finally, we'll click on "Got it" to finish setting up our MetaMask wallet.

```javascript
Got it
```

MetaMask will then appear in the top right corner of our browser. To access MetaMask, we'll click on this icon. 

MetaMask provides us with an interface to manage our wallet. We can create multiple accounts by clicking on "My accounts," then "Create account." 

```javascript
My accounts
Create account
```

We can see the addresses of our different accounts by clicking on the three dots, then "Expand view."

```javascript
...
Expand view
```

We'll close this window to continue. 

In the top right corner, we'll see a section that says "Ethereum Mainnet." This is the main network of Ethereum.  We will not be working with the Ethereum Mainnet in this course. We will be working with a testnet. We can see the different testnets that our MetaMask has access to by clicking on "Ethereum Mainnet."

```javascript
Ethereum Mainnet
```

We can switch the network we're working on by simply clicking on another network. To see testnets, we have to "enable test networks".

We'll be working with the Sepolia testnet or Tenderly Virtual networks for this course. 

```javascript
Sepolia test network
```

We can see that our network has changed up here. 

Remember, testnets are just like a real network, but you don't have to spend any real money to use them. 

Let's switch to the Sepolia test network by clicking on the network drop down, then selecting "Sepolia test network."

```javascript
Sepolia test network
```

We can see our network has changed here, and we have zero Sepolia ETH. This makes sense because this is a brand new wallet, and we haven't put any money into this brand new account yet, so of course, we have zero.

In the next lesson, we'll dive into using testnets and learn more about them.
