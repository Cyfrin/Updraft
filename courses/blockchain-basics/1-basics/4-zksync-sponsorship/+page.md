### Layer 2 Solutions

In the context of blockchain technology, Layer 2 (L2) solutions like ZKsync offer significant benefits, including increased transaction speed and reduced costs. As ZKsync continues to mature, the differences between deploying contracts on Ethereum and ZKsync are expected to diminish. Future lessons by Ciara will delve deeper into how L2 solutions work and why they integrate into the blockchain ecosystem.

We extend our gratitude to Matter Labs and the ZKsync team for being the lead sponsor of Cyfrin Updraft: their commitment to making Web3 developer and security research education accessible has allowed us to offer this course for free. Additionally, we thank Arbitrum and Optimism for their historical support. Transparency is crucial, so we list all sponsors in the [dedicated section](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu?tab=readme-ov-file#sponsors) of the GitHub repository associated with this course. We also provide alternatives to ensure you can choose the technology that best suits your needs.

### Deploying to production

As of recording, deploying professional smart contracts to ZKsync may present some challenges. We recommend consulting our [guide](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu/blob/main/read-before-deploying-serious-projects-to-zksync.md) in the GitHub repository before deploying a production smart contract on ZKsync.
