### Introduction

In this course, we will cover essential topics for Web3 developers, including the Solidity programming language, Foundry, and Vyper. Additionally, we will guide you through deploying to the Layer 2 solution, ZK Sync.

### Layer 2 Solutions

In the context of blockchain technology, Layer 2 (L2) solutions like ZK Sync offer significant benefits, including increased transaction speed and reduced costs. As ZK Sync continues to mature, the differences between deploying contracts on Ethereum and ZK Sync are expected to diminish. Future lessons by Ciara will delve deeper into how L2 solutions work and why they integrate to the blockchain ecosystem.

We extend our gratitude to Matter Labs and the ZK Sync team for being the lead sponsor of Cyphrin Updraft: their commitment to making Web3 developer and security research education accessible has allowed us to offer this course for free. Additionally, we thank Arbitrum and Optimism for their historical support. Transparency is crucial, so we list all sponsors in the [dedicated section](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu?tab=readme-ov-file#sponsors) of the GitHub repository associated with this course. We also provide alternatives to ensure you can choose the technology that best suits your needs.

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT** <br>
> At the end of each section, you'll find links to challenge contracts that you can solve to earn NFTs.

### Deploying to production

As of recording, deploying professional smart contracts to ZK Sync may present some challenges. We recommend consulting our [guide](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu/blob/main/read-before-deploying-serious-projects-to-zksync.md) in the GitHub repository for detailed guidance before deploying a production smart contract on ZK Sync.
