## Testnets 

We're going to explore how to use testnets to deploy smart contracts and make transactions. 

### Tenderly 

We'll be using a virtual testnet tool called "Tenderly." This is our preferred method for interacting with a testnet.

### Why Tenderly?

Using a virtual testnet is our preferred method for interacting with a testnet. Obtaining actual testnet funds can be very challenging.

### Testnet Transactions (Optional)

We'll also take a look at what sending a transaction on a testnet looks like. This section is optional.

If you are unable to obtain testnet funds, don't worry. You can still learn everything you need to know by using Tenderly. 

### Testnet Exploration (Optional)

We'll explore what a different explorer looks like, such as Etherscan or Blockscout. This section is optional. 

### Summary

The testnet sections are optional throughout CipherUpdraft. If you want to experience it firsthand, we highly recommend using Tenderly.
